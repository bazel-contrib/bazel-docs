## About Bazel

### Intro to Bazel
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/intro
- From: /about/intro

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms. Bazel supports large codebases across multiple repositories, and large numbers of users.

## Benefits

Bazel offers the following advantages:

### Why Bazel?
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/why
- From: /about/why

Bazel is a fast, correct, and extensible build tool with integrated testing that supports multiple languages, repositories, and platforms in an industry-leading ecosystem.

Bazel is a [fast](#fast), [correct](#correct), and [extensible](#extensible)
build tool with [integrated testing](#integrated-testing) that supports multiple
[languages](#multi-language), [repositories](#multi-repository), and
[platforms](#multi-platform) in an industry-leading [ecosystem](#ecosystem).

## Bazel is fast

Bazel knows exactly what input files each build command needs, avoiding
unnecessary work by re-running only when the set of input files have
changed between each build.
It runs build commands with as much parallelism as possible, either within the
same computer or on [remote build nodes](/remote/rbe). If the structure of build
allows for it, it can run thousands of build or test commands at the same time.

### Bazel Vision
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/vision
- From: /about/vision

Any software developer can efficiently build, test, and package any project, of any size or complexity, with tooling that's easy to adopt and extend.

Any software developer can efficiently build, test, and package
any project, of any size or complexity, with tooling that's easy to adopt and
extend.

*   **Engineers can take build fundamentals for granted.** Software developers
    focus on the creative process of authoring code because the mechanical
    process of build and test is solved. When customizing the build system to
    support new languages or unique organizational needs, users focus on the
    aspects of extensibility that are unique to their use case, without having
    to reinvent the basic plumbing.

*   **Engineers can easily contribute to any project.** A developer who wants to
    start working on a new project can simply clone the project and run the
    build. There's no need for local configuration - it just works. With
    cross-platform remote execution, they can work on any machine anywhere and
    fully test their changes against all platforms the project targets.
    Engineers can quickly configure the build for a new project or incrementally
    migrate an existing build.

## What is Bazel?

Bazel is a tool that automates software builds and tests. Supported build tasks include running compilers and linkers to produce executable programs and libraries, and assembling deployable packages for Android, iOS and other target environments. Bazel is similar to other tools like Make, Ant, Gradle, Buck, Pants and Maven.

A build system is one of the most important parts of an engineering organization
because each developer interacts with it potentially dozens or hundreds of times
per day. A fully featured build system is necessary to enable developer
productivity as an organization scales. For individual developers, it's
straightforward to just compile your code and so a build system might seem
excessive. But at a larger scale, having a build system helps with managing
shared dependencies, such as relying on another part of the code base, or an
external resource, such as a library. Build systems help to make sure that you
have everything you need to build your code before it starts building. Build
systems also increase velocity when they're set up to help engineers share
resources and results.

This section covers some history and basics of building and build systems,
including design decisions that went into making Bazel. If you're
familiar with artifact-based build systems, such as Bazel, Buck, and Pants, you
can skip this section, but it's a helpful overview to understand why
artifact-based build systems are excellent at enabling scale.

Note: Much of this section's content comes from the _Build Systems and
Build Philosophy_ chapter of the
[_Software Engineering at Google_ book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch18.html).

This page provides information about how to handle backward compatibility, including migrating from one release to another and how to communicate incompatible changes.

This page provides information about how to handle backward compatibility,
including migrating from one release to another and how to communicate
incompatible changes.

Bazel is evolving. Minor versions released as part of an [LTS major
version](/release#bazel-versioning) are fully backward-compatible. New major LTS
releases may contain incompatible changes that require some migration effort.
For more information about Bazel's release model, please check out the [Release
Model](/release) page.

## Summary

### Rule Compatibility
- URL: https://bazel.build/release/rule-compatibility
- From: /release/rule-compatibility

Bazel Starlark rules can break compatibility with Bazel LTS releases in the following two scenarios:

Bazel Starlark rules can break compatibility with Bazel LTS releases in the
following two scenarios:

1.  The rule breaks compatibility with future LTS releases because a feature it
    depends on is removed from Bazel at HEAD.
1.  The rule breaks compatibility with the current or older LTS releases because
    a feature it depends on is only available in newer Bazel LTS releases.

Meanwhile, the rule itself can ship incompatible changes for their users as
well. When combined with breaking changes in Bazel, upgrading the rule version
and Bazel version can often be a source of frustration for Bazel users. This
page covers how rules authors should maintain rule compatibility with Bazel to
make it easier for users to upgrade Bazel and rules.

### BUILD Style Guide

## Prefer DAMP BUILD files over DRY

## Prefer DAMP BUILD files over DRY

The DRY principle — "Don't Repeat Yourself" — encourages uniqueness by
introducing abstractions such as variables and functions to avoid redundancy in
code.

In contrast, the DAMP principle — "Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases" —
encourages readability over uniqueness to make files easier to understand and
maintain.

### Sharing Variables
- URL: https://bazel.build/build/share-variables
- From: /build/share-variables

BUILD files are intended to be simple and declarative. They will typically consist of a series of target declarations. As your code base and your BUILD files get larger, you will probably notice some duplication, such as:

## Extending

### Extension Overview
- URL: https://bazel.build/extending/concepts
- From: /extending/concepts

{/ [TOC] /}

{/* [TOC] */}

This page describes how to extend the BUILD language using macros
and rules.

Bazel extensions are files ending in `.bzl`. Use a
[load statement](/concepts/build-files#load) to import a symbol from an extension.

### Rules Tutorial
- URL: https://bazel.build/rules/rules-tutorial
- From: /rules/rules-tutorial

{/ [TOC] /}

{/* [TOC] */}

[Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) is a Python-like
configuration language originally developed for use in Bazel and since adopted
by other tools. Bazel's `BUILD` and `.bzl` files are written in a dialect of
Starlark properly known as the "Build Language", though it is often simply
referred to as "Starlark", especially when emphasizing that a feature is
expressed in the Build Language as opposed to being a built-in or "native" part
of Bazel. Bazel augments the core language with numerous build-related functions
such as `glob`, `genrule`, `java_binary`, and so on.

See the
[Bazel](/start/) and [Starlark](/extending/concepts) documentation for
more details, and the
[Rules SIG template](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules-template) as a
starting point for new rulesets.

### Creating a Symbolic Macro
- URL: https://bazel.build/rules/macro-tutorial

IMPORTANT: This tutorial is for symbolic macros – the new macro system introduced in Bazel 8. If you need to support older Bazel versions, you will want to write a legacy macro instead; take a look at Creating a Legacy Macro.

IMPORTANT: This tutorial is for [*symbolic macros*](/extending/macros) – the new
macro system introduced in Bazel 8. If you need to support older Bazel versions,
you will want to write a [legacy macro](/extending/legacy-macros) instead; take
a look at [Creating a Legacy Macro](legacy-macro-tutorial).

Imagine that you need to run a tool as part of your build. For example, you
may want to generate or preprocess a source file, or compress a binary. In this
tutorial, you are going to create a symbolic macro that resizes an image.

Macros are suitable for simple tasks. If you want to do anything more
complicated, for example add support for a new programming language, consider
creating a [rule](/extending/rules). Rules give you more control and flexibility.

### Using Macros to Create Custom Verbs

Day-to-day interaction with Bazel happens primarily through a few commands: build, test, and run. At times, though, these can feel limited: you may want to push packages to a repository, publish documentation for end-users, or deploy an application with Kubernetes. But Bazel doesn't have a publish or deploy command – where do these actions fit in?

Day-to-day interaction with Bazel happens primarily through a few commands:
`build`, `test`, and `run`. At times, though, these can feel limited: you may
want to push packages to a repository, publish documentation for end-users, or
deploy an application with Kubernetes. But Bazel doesn't have a `publish` or
`deploy` command – where do these actions fit in?

## The bazel run command

Bazel's focus on hermeticity, reproducibility, and incrementality means the
`build` and `test` commands aren't helpful for the above tasks. These actions
may run in a sandbox, with limited network access, and aren't guaranteed to be
re-run with every `bazel build`.

This page outlines how contributors can propose and make changes to the Bazel code base.

This page outlines how contributors can propose and make changes to the Bazel
code base.

1. Read the [Bazel Contribution policy](/contribute/policy).
1. Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/) to
   discuss your plan and design. Pull requests that change or add behavior
   need a corresponding issue for tracking.
1. If you're proposing significant changes, write a
   [design document](/contribute/design-documents).
1. Ensure you've signed a [Contributor License
   Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com).
1. Prepare a git commit that implements the feature. Don't forget to add tests
   and update the documentation. If your change has user-visible effects, please
   [add release notes](/contribute/release-notes). If it is an incompatible change,
   read the [guide for rolling out breaking changes](/contribute/breaking-changes).
1. Create a pull request on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pulls). If you're new to GitHub,
   read [about pull
   requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Note that
   we restrict permissions to create branches on the main Bazel repository, so
   you will need to push your commit to [your own fork of the
   repository](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/).
1. A Bazel maintainer should assign you a reviewer within two business days
   (excluding holidays in the USA and Germany). If you aren't assigned a
   reviewer in that time, you can request one by emailing
   [bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com]
   (mailto:bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com).
1. Work with the reviewer to complete a code review. For each change, create a
   new commit and push it to make changes to your pull request. If the review
   takes too long (for instance, if the reviewer is unresponsive), send an email to
   [bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com]
   (mailto:bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com).
1. After your review is complete, a Bazel maintainer applies your patch to
   Google's internal version control system.

This triggers internal presubmit checks
   that may suggest more changes. If you haven't expressed a preference, the
   maintainer submitting your change  adds "trivial" changes (such as
   [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))) that don't affect
   design. If deeper changes are required or you'd prefer to apply
   changes directly, you and the reviewer should communicate preferences
   clearly in review comments.

This document is a description of the codebase and how Bazel is structured. It
is intended for people willing to contribute to Bazel, not for end-users.

## Introduction

The codebase of Bazel is large (~350KLOC production code and ~260 KLOC test
code) and no one is familiar with the whole landscape: everyone knows their
particular valley very well, but few know what lies over the hills in every
direction.

### A Guide to Skyframe `StateMachine`s
- URL: https://bazel.build/contribute/statemachine-guide
- From: /contribute/statemachine-guide

## Overview

## Overview

A Skyframe `StateMachine` is a *deconstructed* function-object that resides on
the heap. It supports flexible and evaluation without redundancy[^1] when
required values are not immediately available but computed asynchronously. The
`StateMachine` cannot tie up a thread resource while waiting, but instead has to
be suspended and resumed. The deconstruction thus exposes explicit re-entry
points so that prior computations can be skipped.

`StateMachine`s can be used to express sequences, branching, structured logical
concurrency and are tailored specifically for Skyframe interaction.
`StateMachine`s can be composed into larger `StateMachine`s and share
sub-`StateMachine`s. Concurrency is always hierarchical by construction and
purely logical. Every concurrent subtask runs in the single shared parent
SkyFunction thread.
