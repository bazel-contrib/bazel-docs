## Why Bazel?

### Intro to Bazel
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/intro
- Source: about/intro.mdx

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle.
It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in
multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms. Bazel supports
large codebases across multiple repositories, and large numbers of users.

## Benefits

Bazel offers the following advantages:

*   **High-level build language.** Bazel uses an abstract, human-readable
    language to describe the build properties of your project at a high
    semantical level. Unlike other tools, Bazel operates on the *concepts*
    of libraries, binaries, scripts, and data sets, shielding you from the
    complexity of writing individual calls to tools such as compilers and
    linkers.

*   **Bazel is fast and reliable.** Bazel caches all previously done work and
    tracks changes to both file content and build commands. This way, Bazel
    knows when something needs to be rebuilt, and rebuilds only that. To further
    speed up your builds, you can set up your project to build in a  highly
    parallel and incremental fashion.

*   **Bazel is multi-platform.** Bazel runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Bazel
    can build binaries and deployable packages for multiple platforms, including
    desktop, server, and mobile, from the same project.

*   **Bazel scales.** Bazel maintains agility while handling builds with 100k+
    source files. It works with multiple repositories and user bases in the tens
    of thousands.

*   **Bazel is extensible.** Many [languages](/rules) are
    supported, and you can extend Bazel to support any other language or
    framework.

## Using Bazel

To build or test a project with Bazel, you typically do the following:

1.  **Set up Bazel.** Download and [install Bazel](/install).

2.  **Set up a project [workspace](/concepts/build-ref#workspaces)**, which is a
    directory where Bazel looks for build inputs and `BUILD` files, and where it
    stores build outputs.

3.  **Write a `BUILD` file**, which tells Bazel what to build and how to
    build it.

    You write your `BUILD` file by declaring build targets using
    [Starlark](/rules/language), a domain-specific language. (See example
    [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/examples/cpp/BUILD).)

    A build target specifies a set of input artifacts that Bazel will build plus
    their dependencies, the build rule Bazel will use to build it, and options
    that configure the build rule.

    A build rule specifies the build tools Bazel will use, such as compilers and
    linkers, and their configurations. Bazel ships with a number of build rules
    covering the most common artifact types in the supported languages on
    supported platforms.

4. **Run Bazel** from the [command line](/reference/command-line-reference). Bazel
   places your outputs within the workspace.

In addition to building, you can also use Bazel to run
[tests](/reference/test-encyclopedia) and [query](/query/guide) the build
to trace dependencies in your code.

## Bazel build process

When running a build or a test, Bazel does the following:

1.  **Loads** the `BUILD` files relevant to the target.

2.  **Analyzes** the inputs and their
    [dependencies](/concepts/dependencies), applies the specified build
    rules, and produces an [action](/extending/concepts#evaluation-model)
    graph.

3.  **Executes** the build actions on the inputs until the final build outputs
    are produced.

Since all previous build work is cached, Bazel can identify and reuse cached
artifacts and only rebuild or retest what's changed. To further enforce
correctness, you can set up Bazel to run builds and tests
[hermetically](/basics/hermeticity) through sandboxing, minimizing skew
and maximizing [reproducibility](/run/build#correct-incremental-rebuilds).

### Action graph

The action graph represents the build artifacts, the relationships between them,
and the build actions that Bazel will perform. Thanks to this graph, Bazel can
[track](/run/build#build-consistency) changes to
file content as well as changes to actions, such as build or test commands, and
know what build work has previously been done. The graph also enables you to
easily [trace dependencies](/query/guide) in your code.

## Getting started tutorials

To get started with Bazel, see [Getting Started](/start/) or jump
directly to the Bazel tutorials:

*   [Tutorial: Build a C++ Project](/start/cpp)
*   [Tutorial: Build a Java Project](/start/java)
*   [Tutorial: Build an Android Application](/start/android-app)
*   [Tutorial: Build an iOS Application](/start/ios-app)

### Why Bazel?
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/why
- Source: about/why.mdx

Bazel is a [fast](#fast), [correct](#correct), and [extensible](#extensible)
build tool with [integrated testing](#integrated-testing) that supports multiple
[languages](#multi-language), [repositories](#multi-repository), and
[platforms](#multi-platform) in an industry-leading [ecosystem](#ecosystem).

## Bazel is fast

Bazel knows exactly what input files each build command needs, avoiding
unnecessary work by re-running only when the set of input files have
changed between each build.
It runs build commands with as much parallelism as possible, either within the
same computer or on [remote build nodes](/remote/rbe). If the structure of build
allows for it, it can run thousands of build or test commands at the same time.

This is supported by multiple caching layers, in memory, on disk and on the
remote build farm, if available. At Google, we routinely achieve cache hit rates
north of 99%.

## Bazel is correct

Bazel ensures that your binaries are built *only* from your own
source code. Bazel actions run in individual sandboxes and Bazel tracks
every input file of the build, only and always re-running build
commands when it needs to. This keeps your binaries up-to-date so that the
[same source code always results in the same binary](/basics/hermeticity), bit
by bit.

Say goodbye to endless `make clean` invocations and to chasing phantom bugs
that were in fact resolved in source code that never got built.

## Bazel is extensible

Harness the full power of Bazel by writing your own rules and macros to
customize Bazel for your specific needs across a wide range of projects.

Bazel rules are written in [Starlark](/rules/language), our
in-house programming language that's a subset of Python. Starlark makes
rule-writing accessible to most developers, while also creating rules that can
be used across the ecosystem.

## Integrated testing

Bazel's [integrated test runner](/docs/user-manual#running-tests)
knows and runs only those tests needing to be re-run, using remote execution
(if available) to run them in parallel. Detect flakes early by using remote
execution to quickly run a test thousands of times.

Bazel [provides facilities](/remote/bep) to upload test results to a central
location, thereby facilitating efficient communication of test outcomes, be it
on CI or by individual developers.

## Multi-language support

Bazel supports many common programming languages including C++, Java,
Kotlin, Python, Go, and Rust. You can build multiple binaries (for example,
backend, web UI and mobile app) in the same Bazel invocation without being
constrained to one language's idiomatic build tool.

## Multi-repository support

Bazel can [gather source code from multiple locations](/external/overview): you
don't need to vendor your dependencies (but you can!), you can instead point
Bazel to the location of your source code or prebuilt artifacts (e.g. a git
repository or Maven Central), and it takes care of the rest.

## Multi-platform support

Bazel can simultaneously build projects for multiple platforms including Linux,
macOS, Windows, and Android. It also provides powerful
[cross-compilation capabilities](/extending/platforms) to build code for one
platform while running the build on another.

## Wide ecosystem

[Industry leaders](/community/users) love Bazel, building a large
community of developers who use and contribute to Bazel. Find a tools, services
and documentation, including [consulting and SaaS offerings](/community/experts)
Bazel can use. Explore extensions like support for programming languages in
our [open source software repositories](/rules).

### Bazel Vision
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/vision
- Source: about/vision.mdx

Any software developer can efficiently build, test, and package
any project, of any size or complexity, with tooling that's easy to adopt and
extend.

*   **Engineers can take build fundamentals for granted.** Software developers
    focus on the creative process of authoring code because the mechanical
    process of build and test is solved. When customizing the build system to
    support new languages or unique organizational needs, users focus on the
    aspects of extensibility that are unique to their use case, without having
    to reinvent the basic plumbing.

*   **Engineers can easily contribute to any project.** A developer who wants to
    start working on a new project can simply clone the project and run the
    build. There's no need for local configuration - it just works. With
    cross-platform remote execution, they can work on any machine anywhere and
    fully test their changes against all platforms the project targets.
    Engineers can quickly configure the build for a new project or incrementally
    migrate an existing build.

*   **Projects can scale to any size codebase, any size team.** Fast,
    incremental testing allows teams to fully validate every change before it is
    committed. This remains true even as repos grow, projects span multiple
    repos, and multiple languages are introduced. Infrastructure does not force
    developers to trade test coverage for build speed.

**We believe Bazel has the potential to fulfill this vision.**

Bazel was built from the ground up to enable builds that are reproducible (a
given set of inputs will always produce the same outputs) and portable (a build
can be run on any machine without affecting the output).

These characteristics support safe incrementality (rebuilding only changed
inputs doesn't introduce the risk of corruption) and distributability (build
actions are isolated and can be offloaded). By minimizing the work needed to do
a correct build and parallelizing that work across multiple cores and remote
systems, Bazel can make any build fast.

Bazel's abstraction layer — instructions specific to languages, platforms, and
toolchains implemented in a simple extensibility language — allows it to be
easily applied to any context.

## Bazel core competencies

1.  Bazel supports **multi-language, multi-platform** builds and tests. You can
    run a single command to build and test your entire source tree, no matter
    which combination of languages and platforms you target.
1.  Bazel builds are **fast and correct**. Every build and test run is
    incremental, on your developers' machines and on CI.
1.  Bazel provides a **uniform, extensible language** to define builds for any
    language or platform.
1.  Bazel allows your builds **to scale** by connecting to remote execution and
    caching services.
1.  Bazel works across **all major development platforms** (Linux, MacOS, and
    Windows).
1.  We accept that adopting Bazel requires effort, but **gradual adoption** is
    possible. Bazel interfaces with de-facto standard tools for a given
    language/platform.

## Serving language communities

Software engineering evolves in the context of language communities — typically,
self-organizing groups of people who use common tools and practices.

To be of use to members of a language community, high-quality Bazel rules must be
available that integrate with the workflows and conventions of that community.

Bazel is committed to be extensible and open, and to support good rulesets for
any language.

###  Requirements of a good ruleset

1.  The rules need to support efficient **building and testing** for the
    language, including code coverage.
1.  The rules need to **interface with a widely-used "package manager"** for the
    language (such as Maven for Java), and support incremental migration paths
    from other widely-used build systems.
1.  The rules need to be **extensible and interoperable**, following
    ["Bazel sandwich"](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-website/blob/master/designs/_posts/2016-08-04-extensibility-for-native-rules.md)
    principles.
1.  The rules need to be **remote-execution ready**. In practice, this means
    **configurable using the [toolchains](/extending/toolchains) mechanism**.
1.  The rules (and Bazel) need to interface with a **widely-used IDE** for the
    language, if there is one.
1.  The rules need to have **thorough, usable documentation,** with introductory
    material for new users, comprehensive docs for expert users.

Each of these items is essential and only together do they deliver on Bazel's
competencies for their particular ecosystem.

They are also, by and large, sufficient - once all are fulfilled, Bazel fully
delivers its value to members of that language community.

### Bazel roadmap
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/roadmap
- Source: about/roadmap.mdx

As Bazel continues to evolve in response to your needs, we want to share our
2025 roadmap update.

We plan to bring Bazel 9.0
[long term support (LTS)](https://bazel.build/release/versioning) to you in late
2025.

## Full transition to Bzlmod

[Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/docs/bzlmod) has been the standard external
dependency system in Bazel since Bazel 7, replacing the legacy WORKSPACE system.
As of March 2025, the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/)
hosts more than 650 modules.

With Bazel 9, we will completely remove WORKSPACE functionality, and Bzlmod will
be the only way to introduce external dependencies in Bazel. To minimize the
migration cost for the community, we'll focus on further improving our migration
[guide](https://bazel.build/external/migration) and
[tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry/tree/main/tools#migrate_to_bzlmodpy).

Additionally, we aim to implement an improved shared repository cache (see
[#12227](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12227))
with garbage collection, and may backport it to Bazel 8. The Bazel Central
Registry will also support verifying SLSA attestations.

## Migration of Android, C++, Java, Python, and Proto rules

With Bazel 8, we have migrated support for Android, Java, Python, and Proto
rules out of the Bazel codebase into Starlark rules in their corresponding
repositories. To ease the migration, we implemented the autoload features in
Bazel, which can be controlled with
[--incompatible_autoload_externally](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043)
and [--incompatible_disable_autoloads_in_main_repo](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/25755)
flags.

With Bazel 9, we aim to disable autoloads by default and require every project
to explicitly load required rules in BUILD files.

We will rewrite most of C++ language support to Starlark, detach it from Bazel
binary and move it into the [/rules_cc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc)
repository. This is the last remaining major language support that is still part
of Bazel.

We're also porting unit tests for C++, Java, and Proto rules to Starlark, moving
them to repositories next to the implementation to increase velocity of rule
authors.

## Starlark improvements

Bazel will have the ability to evaluate symbolic macros lazily. This means that
a symbolic macro won't run if the targets it declares are not requested,
improving performance for very large packages.

Starlark will have an experimental type system, similar to Python's type
annotations. We expect the type system to stabilize _after_ Bazel 9 is launched.

## Configurability

Our main focus is reducing the cost and confusion of build flags.

We're [experimenting](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24839) with a
new project configuration model that doesn't make users have to know which build
and test flags to set where. So `$ bazel test //foo` automatically sets the
right flags based on `foo`'s project's policy. This will likely remain
experimental in 9.0 but guiding feedback is welcome.

[Flag scoping](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/24042) lets you strip
out Starlark flags when they leave project boundaries, so they don't break
caching on transitive dependencies that don't need them. This makes builds that
use [transitions](https://bazel.build/extending/config#user-defined-transitions)
cheaper and faster.
[Here's](https://github.com/gregestren/snippets/tree/master/project_scoped_flags)
an example. We're extending the idea to control which flags propagate to
[exec configurations](https://bazel.build/extending/rules#configurations) and
are considering even more flexible support like custom Starlark to determine
which dependency edges should propagate flags.

We're up-prioritizing effort to move built-in language flags out of Bazel and
into Starlark, where they can live with related rule definitions.

## Remote execution improvements

We plan to add support for asynchronous execution, speeding up remote execution
by increasing parallelism.

### FAQ
- URL: https://bazel.build/about/faq
- Source: about/faq.mdx

If you have questions or need support, see [Getting Help](/help).

## What is Bazel?

Bazel is a tool that automates software builds and tests. Supported build tasks include running compilers and linkers to produce executable programs and libraries, and assembling deployable packages for Android, iOS and other target environments. Bazel is similar to other tools like Make, Ant, Gradle, Buck, Pants and Maven.

## What is special about Bazel?

Bazel was designed to fit the way software is developed at Google. It has the following features:

*   Multi-language support: Bazel supports [many languages](/reference/be/overview), and can be extended to support arbitrary programming languages.
*   High-level build language: Projects are described in the `BUILD` language, a concise text format that describes a project as sets of small interconnected libraries, binaries and tests. In contrast, with tools like Make, you have to describe individual files and compiler invocations.
*   Multi-platform support: The same tool and the same `BUILD` files can be used to build software for different architectures, and even different platforms. At Google, we use Bazel to build everything from server applications running on systems in our data centers to client apps running on mobile phones.
*   Reproducibility: In `BUILD` files, each library, test and binary must specify its direct dependencies completely. Bazel uses this dependency information to know what must be rebuilt when you make changes to a source file, and which tasks can run in parallel. This means that all builds are incremental and will always produce the same result.
*   Scalable: Bazel can handle large builds; at Google, it is common for a server binary to have 100k source files, and builds where no files were changed take about ~200ms.

## Why doesn’t Google use...?

*   Make, Ninja: These tools give very exact control over what commands get invoked to build files, but it’s up to the user to write rules that are correct.
    * Users interact with Bazel on a higher level. For example, Bazel has built-in rules for “Java test”, “C++ binary”, and notions such as “target platform” and “host platform”. These rules have been battle tested to be foolproof.
*   Ant and Maven: Ant and Maven are primarily geared toward Java, while Bazel handles multiple languages. Bazel encourages subdividing codebases in smaller reusable units, and can rebuild only ones that need rebuilding. This speeds up development when working with larger codebases.
*   Gradle: Bazel configuration files are much more structured than Gradle’s, letting Bazel understand exactly what each action does. This allows for more parallelism and better reproducibility.
*   Pants, Buck: Both tools were created and developed by ex-Googlers at Twitter and Foursquare, and Facebook respectively. They have been modeled after Bazel, but their feature sets are different, so they aren’t viable alternatives for us.

## Where did Bazel come from?

Bazel is a flavor of the tool that Google uses to build its server software internally. It has expanded to build other software as well, like mobile apps (iOS, Android) that connect to our servers.

## Did you rewrite your internal tool as open-source? Is it a fork?

Bazel shares most of its code with the internal tool and its rules are used for millions of builds every day.

## Why did Google build Bazel?

A long time ago, Google built its software using large, generated Makefiles. These led to slow and unreliable builds, which began to interfere with our developers’ productivity and the company’s agility. Bazel was a way to solve these problems.

## Does Bazel require a build cluster?

Bazel runs build operations locally by default. However, Bazel can also connect to a build cluster for even faster builds and tests. See our documentation on [remote execution and caching](/remote/rbe) and [remote caching](/remote/caching) for further details.

## How does the Google development process work?

For our server code base, we use the following development workflow:

*   All our server code is in a single, gigantic version control system.
*   Everybody builds their software with Bazel.
*   Different teams own different parts of the source tree, and make their components available as `BUILD` targets.
*   Branching is primarily used for managing releases, so everybody develops their software at the head revision.

Bazel is a cornerstone of this philosophy: since Bazel requires all dependencies to be fully specified, we can predict which programs and tests are affected by a change, and vet them before submission.

More background on the development process at Google can be found on the [eng tools blog](http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/).

## Why did you open up Bazel?

Building software should be fun and easy. Slow and unpredictable builds take the fun out of programming.

## Why would I want to use Bazel?

*   Bazel may give you faster build times because it can recompile only the files that need to be recompiled. Similarly, it can skip re-running tests that it knows haven’t changed.
*   Bazel produces deterministic results. This eliminates skew between incremental and clean builds, laptop and CI system, etc.
*   Bazel can build different client and server apps with the same tool from the same workspace. For example, you can change a client/server protocol in a single commit, and test that the updated mobile app works with the updated server, building both with the same tool, reaping all the aforementioned benefits of Bazel.

## Can I see examples?

Yes; see a [simple example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/examples/cpp/BUILD)
or read the [Bazel source code](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/BUILD) for a more complex example.


## What is Bazel best at?

Bazel shines at building and testing projects with the following properties:

*   Projects with a large codebase
*   Projects written in (multiple) compiled languages
*   Projects that deploy on multiple platforms
*   Projects that have extensive tests

## Where can I run Bazel?

Bazel runs on Linux, macOS (OS X), and Windows.

Porting to other UNIX platforms should be relatively easy, as long as a JDK is available for the platform.

## What should I not use Bazel for?

*   Bazel tries to be smart about caching. This means that it is not good for running build operations whose outputs should not be cached. For example, the following steps should not be run from Bazel:
    *   A compilation step that fetches data from the internet.
    *   A test step that connects to the QA instance of your site.
    *   A deployment step that changes your site’s cloud configuration.
*   If your build consists of a few long, sequential steps, Bazel may not be able to help much. You’ll get more speed by breaking long steps into smaller, discrete targets that Bazel can run in parallel.

## How stable is Bazel’s feature set?

The core features (C++, Java, and shell rules) have extensive use inside Google, so they are thoroughly tested and have very little churn. Similarly, we test new versions of Bazel across hundreds of thousands of targets every day to find regressions, and we release new versions multiple times every month.

In short, except for features marked as experimental, Bazel should Just Work. Changes to non-experimental rules will be backward compatible. A more detailed list of feature support statuses can be found in our [support document](/contribute/support).

## How stable is Bazel as a binary?

Inside Google, we make sure that Bazel crashes are very rare. This should also hold for our open source codebase.

## How can I start using Bazel?

See [Getting Started](/start/).

## Doesn’t Docker solve the reproducibility problems?

With Docker you can easily create sandboxes with fixed OS releases, for example, Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 21. This solves the problem of reproducibility for the system environment – that is, “which version of /usr/bin/c++ do I need?”

Docker does not address reproducibility with regard to changes in the source code. Running Make with an imperfectly written Makefile inside a Docker container can still yield unpredictable results.

Inside Google, we check tools into source control for reproducibility. In this way, we can vet changes to tools (“upgrade GCC to 4.6.1”) with the same mechanism as changes to base libraries (“fix bounds check in OpenSSL”).

## Can I build binaries for deployment on Docker?

With Bazel, you can build standalone, statically linked binaries in C/C++, and self-contained jar files for Java. These run with few dependencies on normal UNIX systems, and as such should be simple to install inside a Docker container.

Bazel has conventions for structuring more complex programs, for example, a Java program that consumes a set of data files, or runs another program as subprocess. It is possible to package up such environments as standalone archives, so they can be deployed on different systems, including Docker images.

## Can I build Docker images with Bazel?

Yes, you can use our [Docker rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker) to build reproducible Docker images.

## Will Bazel make my builds reproducible automatically?

For Java and C++ binaries, yes, assuming you do not change the toolchain. If you have build steps that involve custom recipes (for example, executing binaries through a shell script inside a rule), you will need to take some extra care:

*   Do not use dependencies that were not declared. Sandboxed execution (–spawn\_strategy=sandboxed, only on Linux) can help find undeclared dependencies.
*   Avoid storing timestamps and user-IDs in generated files. ZIP files and other archives are especially prone to this.
*   Avoid connecting to the network. Sandboxed execution can help here too.
*   Avoid processes that use random numbers, in particular, dictionary traversal is randomized in many programming languages.

## Do you have binary releases?

Yes, you can find the latest [release binaries](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/latest) and review our [release policy](/release/)

## I use Eclipse/IntelliJ/XCode. How does Bazel interoperate with IDEs?

For IntelliJ, check out the [IntelliJ with Bazel plugin](https://ij.bazel.build/).

For XCode, check out [Tulsi](http://tulsi.bazel.build/).

For Eclipse, check out [E4B plugin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/e4b).

For other IDEs, check out the [blog post](https://blog.bazel.build/2016/06/10/ide-support.html) on how these plugins work.

## I use Jenkins/CircleCI/TravisCI. How does Bazel interoperate with CI systems?

Bazel returns a non-zero exit code if the build or test invocation fails, and this should be enough for basic CI integration. Since Bazel does not need clean builds for correctness, the CI system should not be configured to clean before starting a build/test run.

Further details on exit codes are in the [User Manual](/docs/user-manual).

## What future features can we expect in Bazel?

See our [Roadmaps](/about/roadmap).

## Can I use Bazel for my INSERT LANGUAGE HERE project?

Bazel is extensible. Anyone can add support for new languages. Many languages are supported: see the [build encyclopedia](/reference/be/overview) for a list of recommendations and [awesomebazel.com](https://awesomebazel.com/) for a more comprehensive list.

If you would like to develop extensions or learn how they work, see the documentation for [extending Bazel](/extending/concepts).

## Can I contribute to the Bazel code base?

See our [contribution guidelines](/contribute/).

## Why isn’t all development done in the open?

We still have to refactor the interfaces between the public code in Bazel and our internal extensions frequently. This makes it hard to do much development in the open.

## Are you done open sourcing Bazel?

Open sourcing Bazel is a work-in-progress. In particular, we’re still working on open sourcing:

*   Many of our unit and integration tests (which should make contributing patches easier).
*   Full IDE integration.

Beyond code, we’d like to eventually have all code reviews, bug tracking, and design decisions happen publicly, with the Bazel community involved. We are not there yet, so some changes will simply appear in the Bazel repository without clear explanation. Despite this lack of transparency, we want to support external developers and collaborate. Thus, we are opening up the code, even though some of the development is still happening internal to Google. Please let us know if anything seems unclear or unjustified as we transition to an open model.

## Are there parts of Bazel that will never be open sourced?

Yes, some of the code base either integrates with Google-specific technology or we have been looking for an excuse to get rid of (or is some combination of the two). These parts of the code base are not available on GitHub and probably never will be.

## How do I contact the team?

We are reachable at bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com.

## Where do I report bugs?

Open an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues).

## What’s up with the word “Blaze” in the codebase?

This is an internal name for the tool. Please refer to Blaze as Bazel.

## Why do other Google projects (Android, Chrome) use other build tools?

Until the first (Alpha) release, Bazel was not available externally, so open source projects such as Chromium and Android could not use it. In addition, the original lack of Windows support was a problem for building Windows applications, such as Chrome. Since the project has matured and become more stable, the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/) is in the process of migrating to Bazel.

## How do you pronounce “Bazel”?

The same way as “basil” (the herb) in US English: “BAY-zel”. It rhymes with “hazel”. IPA: /ˈbeɪzˌəl/


## Build system basics

### Build Basics
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics
- Source: basics/index.mdx

A build system is one of the most important parts of an engineering organization
because each developer interacts with it potentially dozens or hundreds of times
per day. A fully featured build system is necessary to enable developer
productivity as an organization scales. For individual developers, it's
straightforward to just compile your code and so a build system might seem
excessive. But at a larger scale, having a build system helps with managing
shared dependencies, such as relying on another part of the code base, or an
external resource, such as a library. Build systems help to make sure that you
have everything you need to build your code before it starts building. Build
systems also increase velocity when they're set up to help engineers share
resources and results.

This section covers some history and basics of building and build systems,
including design decisions that went into making Bazel. If you're
familiar with artifact-based build systems, such as Bazel, Buck, and Pants, you
can skip this section, but it's a helpful overview to understand why
artifact-based build systems are excellent at enabling scale.

Build Philosophy_ chapter of the

### Why a Build System?
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/build-systems
- Source: basics/build-systems.mdx

This page discusses what build systems are, what they do, why you should use a
build system, and why compilers and build scripts aren't the best choice as your
organization starts to scale. It's intended for developers who don't have much
experience with a build system.

## What is a build system?

Fundamentally, all build systems have a straightforward purpose: they transform
the source code written by engineers into executable binaries that can be read
by machines. Build systems aren't just for human-authored code; they also allow
machines to create builds automatically, whether for testing or for releases to
production. In an organization with thousands of engineers, it's common that
most builds are triggered automatically rather than directly by engineers.

### Can't I just use a compiler?

The need for a build system might not be immediately obvious. Most engineers
don't use a build system while learning to code: most start by invoking tools
like `gcc` or `javac` directly from the command line, or the equivalent in an
integrated development environment (IDE). As long as all the source code is in
the same directory, a command like this works fine:

```posix-terminal
javac *.java
```

This instructs the Java compiler to take every Java source file in the current
directory and turn it into a binary class file. In the simplest case, this is
all you need.

However, as soon as code expands, the complications begin. `javac` is smart
enough to look in subdirectories of the current directory to find code to
import. But it has no way of finding code stored in _other parts_ of the
filesystem (perhaps a library shared by several projects). It also only knows
how to build Java code. Large systems often involve different pieces written in
a variety of programming languages with webs of dependencies among those pieces,
meaning no compiler for a single language can possibly build the entire system.

Once you're dealing with code from multiple languages or multiple compilation
units, building code is no longer a one-step process. Now you must evaluate what
your code depends on and build those pieces in the proper order, possibly using
a different set of tools for each piece. If any dependencies change, you must
repeat this process to avoid depending on stale binaries. For a codebase of even
moderate size, this process quickly becomes tedious and error-prone.

The compiler also doesn’t know anything about how to handle external
dependencies, such as third-party `JAR` files in Java. Without a build system,
you could manage this by downloading the dependency from the internet, sticking
it in a `lib` folder on the hard drive, and configuring the compiler to read
libraries from that directory. Over time, it's difficult to maintain the
updates, versions, and source of these external dependencies.

### What about shell scripts?

Suppose that your hobby project starts out simple enough that you can build it
using just a compiler, but you begin running into some of the problems described
previously. Maybe you still don’t think you need a build system and can automate
away the tedious parts using some simple shell scripts that take care of
building things in the correct order. This helps out for a while, but pretty
soon you start running into even more problems:

*   It becomes tedious. As your system grows more complex, you begin spending
    almost as much time working on your build scripts as on real code. Debugging
    shell scripts is painful, with more and more hacks being layered on top of
    one another.

*   It’s slow. To make sure you weren’t accidentally relying on stale libraries,
    you have your build script build every dependency in order every time you
    run it. You think about adding some logic to detect which parts need to be
    rebuilt, but that sounds awfully complex and error prone for a script. Or
    you think about specifying which parts need to be rebuilt each time, but
    then you’re back to square one.

*   Good news: it’s time for a release! Better go figure out all the arguments
    you need to pass to the jar command to make your final build. And remember
    how to upload it and push it out to the central repository. And build and
    push the documentation updates, and send out a notification to users. Hmm,
    maybe this calls for another script...

*   Disaster! Your hard drive crashes, and now you need to recreate your entire
    system. You were smart enough to keep all of your source files in version
    control, but what about those libraries you downloaded? Can you find them
    all again and make sure they were the same version as when you first
    downloaded them? Your scripts probably depended on particular tools being
    installed in particular places—can you restore that same environment so that
    the scripts work again? What about all those environment variables you set a
    long time ago to get the compiler working just right and then forgot about?

*   Despite the problems, your project is successful enough that you’re able to
    begin hiring more engineers. Now you realize that it doesn’t take a disaster
    for the previous problems to arise—you need to go through the same painful
    bootstrapping process every time a new developer joins your team. And
    despite your best efforts, there are still small differences in each
    person’s system. Frequently, what works on one person’s machine doesn’t work
    on another’s, and each time it takes a few hours of debugging tool paths or
    library versions to figure out where the difference is.

*   You decide that you need to automate your build system. In theory, this is
    as simple as getting a new computer and setting it up to run your build
    script every night using cron. You still need to go through the painful
    setup process, but now you don’t have the benefit of a human brain being
    able to detect and resolve minor problems. Now, every morning when you get
    in, you see that last night’s build failed because yesterday a developer
    made a change that worked on their system but didn’t work on the automated
    build system. Each time it’s a simple fix, but it happens so often that you
    end up spending a lot of time each day discovering and applying these simple
    fixes.

*   Builds become slower and slower as the project grows. One day, while waiting
    for a build to complete, you gaze mournfully at the idle desktop of your
    coworker, who is on vacation, and wish there were a way to take advantage of
    all that wasted computational power.

You’ve run into a classic problem of scale. For a single developer working on at
most a couple hundred lines of code for at most a week or two (which might have
been the entire experience thus far of a junior developer who just graduated
university), a compiler is all you need. Scripts can maybe take you a little bit
farther. But as soon as you need to coordinate across multiple developers and
their machines, even a perfect build script isn’t enough because it becomes very
difficult to account for the minor differences in those machines. At this point,
this simple approach breaks down and it’s time to invest in a real build system.

### Task-Based Build Systems
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/task-based-builds
- Source: basics/task-based-builds.mdx

This page covers task-based build systems, how they work and some of the
complications that can occur with task-based systems. After shell scripts,
task-based build systems are the next logical evolution of building.


## Understanding task-based build systems

In a task-based build system, the fundamental unit of work is the task. Each
task is a script that can execute any sort of logic, and tasks specify other
tasks as dependencies that must run before them. Most major build systems in use
today, such as Ant, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, and Rake, are task based. Instead of
shell scripts, most modern build systems require engineers to create build files
that describe how to perform the build.

Take this example from the
[Ant manual](https://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html):

```xml
<project name="MyProject" default="dist" basedir=".">
   <description>
     simple example build file
   </description>
   <!-- set global properties for this build -->
   <property name="src" location="src"/>
   <property name="build" location="build"/>
   <property name="dist" location="dist"/>

   <target name="init">
     <!-- Create the time stamp -->
     <tstamp/>
     <!-- Create the build directory structure used by compile -->
     <mkdir dir="${build}"/>
   </target>
   <target name="compile" depends="init"
       description="compile the source">
     <!-- Compile the Java code from ${src} into ${build} -->
     <javac srcdir="${src}" destdir="${build}"/>
   </target>
   <target name="dist" depends="compile"
       description="generate the distribution">
     <!-- Create the distribution directory -->
     <mkdir dir="${dist}/lib"/>
     <!-- Put everything in ${build} into the MyProject-${DSTAMP}.jar file -->
     <jar jarfile="${dist}/lib/MyProject-${DSTAMP}.jar" basedir="${build}"/>
   </target>
   <target name="clean"
       description="clean up">
     <!-- Delete the ${build} and ${dist} directory trees -->
     <delete dir="${build}"/>
     <delete dir="${dist}"/>
   </target>
</project>
```

The buildfile is written in XML and defines some simple metadata about the build
along with a list of tasks (the `<target>` tags in the XML). (Ant uses the word
_target_ to represent a _task_, and it uses the word _task_ to refer to
_commands_.) Each task executes a list of possible commands defined by Ant,
which here include creating and deleting directories, running `javac`, and
creating a JAR file. This set of commands can be extended by user-provided
plug-ins to cover any sort of logic. Each task can also define the tasks it
depends on via the depends attribute. These dependencies form an acyclic graph,
as seen in Figure 1.

[![Acrylic graph showing dependencies](/images/task-dependencies.png)](/images/task-dependencies.png)

Figure 1. An acyclic graph showing dependencies

Users perform builds by providing tasks to Ant’s command-line tool. For example,
when a user types `ant dist`, Ant takes the following steps:

1.  Loads a file named `build.xml` in the current directory and parses it to
    create the graph structure shown in Figure 1.
1.  Looks for the task named `dist` that was provided on the command line and
    discovers that it has a dependency on the task named `compile`.
1.  Looks for the task named `compile` and discovers that it has a dependency on
    the task named `init`.
1.  Looks for the task named `init` and discovers that it has no dependencies.
1.  Executes the commands defined in the `init` task.
1.  Executes the commands defined in the `compile` task given that all of that
    task’s dependencies have been run.
1.  Executes the commands defined in the `dist` task given that all of that
    task’s dependencies have been run.

In the end, the code executed by Ant when running the `dist` task is equivalent
to the following shell script:

```posix-terminal
./createTimestamp.sh

mkdir build/

javac src/* -d build/

mkdir -p dist/lib/

jar cf dist/lib/MyProject-$(date --iso-8601).jar build/*
```

When the syntax is stripped away, the buildfile and the build script actually
aren’t too different. But we’ve already gained a lot by doing this. We can
create new buildfiles in other directories and link them together. We can easily
add new tasks that depend on existing tasks in arbitrary and complex ways. We
need only pass the name of a single task to the `ant` command-line tool, and it
determines everything that needs to be run.

Ant is an old piece of software, originally released in 2000. Other tools like
Maven and Gradle have improved on Ant in the intervening years and essentially
replaced it by adding features like automatic management of external
dependencies and a cleaner syntax without any XML. But the nature of these newer
systems remains the same: they allow engineers to write build scripts in a
principled and modular way as tasks and provide tools for executing those tasks
and managing dependencies among them.

## The dark side of task-based build systems

Because these tools essentially let engineers define any script as a task, they
are extremely powerful, allowing you to do pretty much anything you can imagine
with them. But that power comes with drawbacks, and task-based build systems can
become difficult to work with as their build scripts grow more complex. The
problem with such systems is that they actually end up giving _too much power to
engineers and not enough power to the system_. Because the system has no idea
what the scripts are doing, performance suffers, as it must be very conservative
in how it schedules and executes build steps. And there’s no way for the system
to confirm that each script is doing what it should, so scripts tend to grow in
complexity and end up being another thing that needs debugging.

### Difficulty of parallelizing build steps

Modern development workstations are quite powerful, with multiple cores that are
capable of executing several build steps in parallel. But task-based systems are
often unable to parallelize task execution even when it seems like they should
be able to. Suppose that task A depends on tasks B and C. Because tasks B and C
have no dependency on each other, is it safe to run them at the same time so
that the system can more quickly get to task A? Maybe, if they don’t touch any
of the same resources. But maybe not—perhaps both use the same file to track
their statuses and running them at the same time causes a conflict. There’s no
way in general for the system to know, so either it has to risk these conflicts
(leading to rare but very difficult-to-debug build problems), or it has to
restrict the entire build to running on a single thread in a single process.
This can be a huge waste of a powerful developer machine, and it completely
rules out the possibility of distributing the build across multiple machines.

### Difficulty performing incremental builds

A good build system allows engineers to perform reliable incremental builds such
that a small change doesn’t require the entire codebase to be rebuilt from
scratch. This is especially important if the build system is slow and unable to
parallelize build steps for the aforementioned reasons. But unfortunately,
task-based build systems struggle here, too. Because tasks can do anything,
there’s no way in general to check whether they’ve already been done. Many tasks
simply take a set of source files and run a compiler to create a set of
binaries; thus, they don’t need to be rerun if the underlying source files
haven’t changed. But without additional information, the system can’t say this
for sure—maybe the task downloads a file that could have changed, or maybe it
writes a timestamp that could be different on each run. To guarantee
correctness, the system typically must rerun every task during each build. Some
build systems try to enable incremental builds by letting engineers specify the
conditions under which a task needs to be rerun. Sometimes this is feasible, but
often it’s a much trickier problem than it appears. For example, in languages
like C++ that allow files to be included directly by other files, it’s
impossible to determine the entire set of files that must be watched for changes
without parsing the input sources. Engineers often end up taking shortcuts, and
these shortcuts can lead to rare and frustrating problems where a task result is
reused even when it shouldn’t be. When this happens frequently, engineers get
into the habit of running clean before every build to get a fresh state,
completely defeating the purpose of having an incremental build in the first
place. Figuring out when a task needs to be rerun is surprisingly subtle, and is
a job better handled by machines than humans.

### Difficulty maintaining and debugging scripts

Finally, the build scripts imposed by task-based build systems are often just
difficult to work with. Though they often receive less scrutiny, build scripts
are code just like the system being built, and are easy places for bugs to hide.
Here are some examples of bugs that are very common when working with a
task-based build system:

*   Task A depends on task B to produce a particular file as output. The owner
    of task B doesn’t realize that other tasks rely on it, so they change it to
    produce output in a different location. This can’t be detected until someone
    tries to run task A and finds that it fails.
*   Task A depends on task B, which depends on task C, which is producing a
    particular file as output that’s needed by task A. The owner of task B
    decides that it doesn’t need to depend on task C any more, which causes task
    A to fail even though task B doesn’t care about task C at all!
*   The developer of a new task accidentally makes an assumption about the
    machine running the task, such as the location of a tool or the value of
    particular environment variables. The task works on their machine, but fails
    whenever another developer tries it.
*   A task contains a nondeterministic component, such as downloading a file
    from the internet or adding a timestamp to a build. Now, people get
    potentially different results each time they run the build, meaning that
    engineers won’t always be able to reproduce and fix one another’s failures
    or failures that occur on an automated build system.
*   Tasks with multiple dependencies can create race conditions. If task A
    depends on both task B and task C, and task B and C both modify the same
    file, task A gets a different result depending on which one of tasks B and C
    finishes first.

There’s no general-purpose way to solve these performance, correctness, or
maintainability problems within the task-based framework laid out here. So long
as engineers can write arbitrary code that runs during the build, the system
can’t have enough information to always be able to run builds quickly and
correctly. To solve the problem, we need to take some power out of the hands of
engineers and put it back in the hands of the system and reconceptualize the
role of the system not as running tasks, but as producing artifacts.

This approach led to the creation of artifact-based build systems, like Blaze
and Bazel.

### Artifact-Based Build Systems
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/artifact-based-builds
- Source: basics/artifact-based-builds.mdx

This page covers artifact-based build systems and the philosophy behind their
creation. Bazel is an artifact-based build system. While task-based build
systems are good step above build scripts, they give too much power to
individual engineers by letting them define their own tasks.

Artifact-based build systems have a small number of tasks defined by the system
that engineers can configure in a limited way. Engineers still tell the system
**what** to build, but the build system determines **how** to build it. As with
task-based build systems, artifact-based build systems, such as Bazel, still
have buildfiles, but the contents of those buildfiles are very different. Rather
than being an imperative set of commands in a Turing-complete scripting language
describing how to produce an output, buildfiles in Bazel are a declarative
manifest describing a set of artifacts to build, their dependencies, and a
limited set of options that affect how they’re built. When engineers run `bazel`
on the command line, they specify a set of targets to build (the **what**), and
Bazel is responsible for configuring, running, and scheduling the compilation
steps (the **how**). Because the build system now has full control over what
tools to run when, it can make much stronger guarantees that allow it to be far
more efficient while still guaranteeing correctness.

## A functional perspective

It’s easy to make an analogy between artifact-based build systems and functional
programming. Traditional imperative programming languages (such as, Java, C, and
Python) specify lists of statements to be executed one after another, in the
same way that task-based build systems let programmers define a series of steps
to execute. Functional programming languages (such as, Haskell and ML), in
contrast, are structured more like a series of mathematical equations. In
functional languages, the programmer describes a computation to perform, but
leaves the details of when and exactly how that computation is executed to the
compiler.

This maps to the idea of declaring a manifest in an artifact-based build system
and letting the system figure out how to execute the build. Many problems can't
be easily expressed using functional programming, but the ones that do benefit
greatly from it: the language is often able to trivially parallelize such
programs and make strong guarantees about their correctness that would be
impossible in an imperative language. The easiest problems to express using
functional programming are the ones that simply involve transforming one piece
of data into another using a series of rules or functions. And that’s exactly
what a build system is: the whole system is effectively a mathematical function
that takes source files (and tools like the compiler) as inputs and produces
binaries as outputs. So, it’s not surprising that it works well to base a build
system around the tenets of functional programming.

## Understanding artifact-based build systems

Google's build system, Blaze, was the first artifact-based build system. Bazel
is the open-sourced version of Blaze.

Here’s what a buildfile (normally named `BUILD`) looks like in Bazel:

```python
java_binary(
    name = "MyBinary",
    srcs = ["MyBinary.java"],
    deps = [
        ":mylib",
    ],
)
java_library(
    name = "mylib",
    srcs = ["MyLibrary.java", "MyHelper.java"],
    visibility = ["//java/com/example/myproduct:__subpackages__"],
    deps = [
        "//java/com/example/common",
        "//java/com/example/myproduct/otherlib",
    ],
)
```

In Bazel, `BUILD` files define targets—the two types of targets here are
`java_binary` and `java_library`. Every target corresponds to an artifact that
can be created by the system: binary targets produce binaries that can be
executed directly, and library targets produce libraries that can be used by
binaries or other libraries. Every target has:

*   `name`: how the target is referenced on the command line and by other
    targets
*   `srcs`: the source files to be compiled to create the artifact for the target
*   `deps`: other targets that must be built before this target and linked into
    it

Dependencies can either be within the same package (such as `MyBinary`’s
dependency on `:mylib`) or on a different package in the same source hierarchy
(such as `mylib`’s dependency on `//java/com/example/common`).

As with task-based build systems, you perform builds using Bazel’s command-line
tool. To build the `MyBinary` target, you run `bazel build :MyBinary`. After
entering that command for the first time in a clean repository, Bazel:

1.  Parses every `BUILD` file in the workspace to create a graph of dependencies
    among artifacts.
1.  Uses the graph to determine the transitive dependencies of `MyBinary`; that
    is, every target that `MyBinary` depends on and every target that those
    targets depend on, recursively.
1.  Builds each of those dependencies, in order. Bazel starts by building each
    target that has no other dependencies and keeps track of which dependencies
    still need to be built for each target. As soon as all of a target’s
    dependencies are built, Bazel starts building that target. This process
    continues until every one of `MyBinary`’s transitive dependencies have been
    built.
1.  Builds `MyBinary` to produce a final executable binary that links in all of
    the dependencies that were built in step 3.

Fundamentally, it might not seem like what’s happening here is that much
different than what happened when using a task-based build system. Indeed, the
end result is the same binary, and the process for producing it involved
analyzing a bunch of steps to find dependencies among them, and then running
those steps in order. But there are critical differences. The first one appears
in step 3: because Bazel knows that each target only produces a Java library, it
knows that all it has to do is run the Java compiler rather than an arbitrary
user-defined script, so it knows that it’s safe to run these steps in parallel.
This can produce an order of magnitude performance improvement over building
targets one at a time on a multicore machine, and is only possible because the
artifact-based approach leaves the build system in charge of its own execution
strategy so that it can make stronger guarantees about parallelism.

The benefits extend beyond parallelism, though. The next thing that this
approach gives us becomes apparent when the developer types `bazel
build :MyBinary` a second time without making any changes: Bazel exits in less
than a second with a message saying that the target is up to date. This is
possible due to the functional programming paradigm we talked about
earlier—Bazel knows that each target is the result only of running a Java
compiler, and it knows that the output from the Java compiler depends only on
its inputs, so as long as the inputs haven’t changed, the output can be reused.
And this analysis works at every level; if `MyBinary.java` changes, Bazel knows
to rebuild `MyBinary` but reuse `mylib`. If a source file for
`//java/com/example/common` changes, Bazel knows to rebuild that library,
`mylib`, and `MyBinary`, but reuse `//java/com/example/myproduct/otherlib`.
Because Bazel knows about the properties of the tools it runs at every step,
it’s able to rebuild only the minimum set of artifacts each time while
guaranteeing that it won’t produce stale builds.

Reframing the build process in terms of artifacts rather than tasks is subtle
but powerful. By reducing the flexibility exposed to the programmer, the build
system can know more about what is being done at every step of the build. It can
use this knowledge to make the build far more efficient by parallelizing build
processes and reusing their outputs. But this is really just the first step, and
these building blocks of parallelism and reuse form the basis for a distributed
and highly scalable build system.

## Other nifty Bazel tricks

Artifact-based build systems fundamentally solve the problems with parallelism
and reuse that are inherent in task-based build systems. But there are still a
few problems that came up earlier that we haven’t addressed. Bazel has clever
ways of solving each of these, and we should discuss them before moving on.

### Tools as dependencies

One problem we ran into earlier was that builds depended on the tools installed
on our machine, and reproducing builds across systems could be difficult due to
different tool versions or locations. The problem becomes even more difficult
when your project uses languages that require different tools based on which
platform they’re being built on or compiled for (such as, Windows versus Linux),
and each of those platforms requires a slightly different set of tools to do the
same job.

Bazel solves the first part of this problem by treating tools as dependencies to
each target. Every `java_library` in the workspace implicitly depends on a Java
compiler, which defaults to a well-known compiler. Whenever Bazel builds a
`java_library`, it checks to make sure that the specified compiler is available
at a known location. Just like any other dependency, if the Java compiler
changes, every artifact that depends on it is rebuilt.

Bazel solves the second part of the problem, platform independence, by setting
[build configurations](/run/build#build-config-cross-compilation). Rather than
targets depending directly on their tools, they depend on types of configurations:

*   **Host configuration**: building tools that run during the build
*   **Target configuration**: building the binary you ultimately requested

### Extending the build system

Bazel comes with targets for several popular programming languages out of the
box, but engineers will always want to do more—part of the benefit of task-based
systems is their flexibility in supporting any kind of build process, and it
would be better not to give that up in an artifact-based build system.
Fortunately, Bazel allows its supported target types to be extended by
[adding custom rules](/extending/rules).

To define a rule in Bazel, the rule author declares the inputs that the rule
requires (in the form of attributes passed in the `BUILD` file) and the fixed
set of outputs that the rule produces. The author also defines the actions that
will be generated by that rule. Each action declares its inputs and outputs,
runs a particular executable or writes a particular string to a file, and can be
connected to other actions via its inputs and outputs. This means that actions
are the lowest-level composable unit in the build system—an action can do
whatever it wants so long as it uses only its declared inputs and outputs, and
Bazel takes care of scheduling actions and caching their results as appropriate.

The system isn’t foolproof given that there’s no way to stop an action developer
from doing something like introducing a nondeterministic process as part of
their action. But this doesn’t happen very often in practice, and pushing the
possibilities for abuse all the way down to the action level greatly decreases
opportunities for errors. Rules supporting many common languages and tools are
widely available online, and most projects will never need to define their own
rules. Even for those that do, rule definitions only need to be defined in one
central place in the repository, meaning most engineers will be able to use
those rules without ever having to worry about their implementation.

### Isolating the environment

Actions sound like they might run into the same problems as tasks in other
systems—isn’t it still possible to write actions that both write to the same
file and end up conflicting with one another? Actually, Bazel makes these
conflicts impossible by using _[sandboxing](/docs/sandboxing)_. On supported
systems, every action is isolated from every other action via a filesystem
sandbox. Effectively, each action can see only a restricted view of the
filesystem that includes the inputs it has declared and any outputs it has
produced. This is enforced by systems such as LXC on Linux, the same technology
behind Docker. This means that it’s impossible for actions to conflict with one
another because they are unable to read any files they don’t declare, and any
files that they write but don’t declare will be thrown away when the action
finishes. Bazel also uses sandboxes to restrict actions from communicating via
the network.

### Making external dependencies deterministic

There’s still one problem remaining: build systems often need to download
dependencies (whether tools or libraries) from external sources rather than
directly building them. This can be seen in the example via the
`@com_google_common_guava_guava//jar` dependency, which downloads a `JAR` file
from Maven.

Depending on files outside of the current workspace is risky. Those files could
change at any time, potentially requiring the build system to constantly check
whether they’re fresh. If a remote file changes without a corresponding change
in the workspace source code, it can also lead to unreproducible builds—a build
might work one day and fail the next for no obvious reason due to an unnoticed
dependency change. Finally, an external dependency can introduce a huge security
risk when it is owned by a third party: if an attacker is able to infiltrate
that third-party server, they can replace the dependency file with something of
their own design, potentially giving them full control over your build
environment and its output.

The fundamental problem is that we want the build system to be aware of these
files without having to check them into source control. Updating a dependency
should be a conscious choice, but that choice should be made once in a central
place rather than managed by individual engineers or automatically by the
system. This is because even with a “Live at Head” model, we still want builds
to be deterministic, which implies that if you check out a commit from last
week, you should see your dependencies as they were then rather than as they are
now.

Bazel and some other build systems address this problem by requiring a
workspacewide manifest file that lists a _cryptographic hash_ for every external
dependency in the workspace. The hash is a concise way to uniquely represent the
file without checking the entire file into source control. Whenever a new
external dependency is referenced from a workspace, that dependency’s hash is
added to the manifest, either manually or automatically. When Bazel runs a
build, it checks the actual hash of its cached dependency against the expected
hash defined in the manifest and redownloads the file only if the hash differs.

If the artifact we download has a different hash than the one declared in the
manifest, the build will fail unless the hash in the manifest is updated. This
can be done automatically, but that change must be approved and checked into
source control before the build will accept the new dependency. This means that
there’s always a record of when a dependency was updated, and an external
dependency can’t change without a corresponding change in the workspace source.
It also means that, when checking out an older version of the source code, the
build is guaranteed to use the same dependencies that it was using at the point
when that version was checked in (or else it will fail if those dependencies are
no longer available).

Of course, it can still be a problem if a remote server becomes unavailable or
starts serving corrupt data—this can cause all of your builds to begin failing
if you don’t have another copy of that dependency available. To avoid this
problem, we recommend that, for any nontrivial project, you mirror all of its
dependencies onto servers or services that you trust and control. Otherwise you
will always be at the mercy of a third party for your build system’s
availability, even if the checked-in hashes guarantee its security.

### Distributed Builds
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/distributed-builds
- Source: basics/distributed-builds.mdx

When you have a large codebase, chains of dependencies can become very deep.
Even simple binaries can often depend on tens of thousands of build targets. At
this scale, it’s simply impossible to complete a build in a reasonable amount
of time on a single machine: no build system can get around the fundamental
laws of physics imposed on a machine’s hardware. The only way to make this work
is with a build system that supports distributed builds wherein the units of
work being done by the system are spread across an arbitrary and scalable
number of machines. Assuming we’ve broken the system’s work into small enough
units (more on this later), this would allow us to complete any build of any
size as quickly as we’re willing to pay for. This scalability is the holy grail
we’ve been working toward by defining an artifact-based build system.

## Remote caching

The simplest type of distributed build is one that only leverages _remote
caching_, which is shown in Figure 1.

[![Distributed build with remote caching](/images/distributed-build-remote-cache.png)](/images/distributed-build-remote-cache.png)

**Figure 1**. A distributed build showing remote caching

Every system that performs builds, including both developer workstations and
continuous integration systems, shares a reference to a common remote cache
service. This service might be a fast and local short-term storage system like
Redis or a cloud service like Google Cloud Storage. Whenever a user needs to
build an artifact, whether directly or as a dependency, the system first checks
with the remote cache to see if that artifact already exists there. If so, it
can download the artifact instead of building it. If not, the system builds the
artifact itself and uploads the result back to the cache. This means that
low-level dependencies that don’t change very often can be built once and shared
across users rather than having to be rebuilt by each user. At Google, many
artifacts are served from a cache rather than built from scratch, vastly
reducing the cost of running our build system.

For a remote caching system to work, the build system must guarantee that builds
are completely reproducible. That is, for any build target, it must be possible
to determine the set of inputs to that target such that the same set of inputs
will produce exactly the same output on any machine. This is the only way to
ensure that the results of downloading an artifact are the same as the results
of building it oneself. Note that this requires that each artifact in the cache
be keyed on both its target and a hash of its inputs—that way, different
engineers could make different modifications to the same target at the same
time, and the remote cache would store all of the resulting artifacts and serve
them appropriately without conflict.

Of course, for there to be any benefit from a remote cache, downloading an
artifact needs to be faster than building it. This is not always the case,
especially if the cache server is far from the machine doing the build. Google’s
network and build system is carefully tuned to be able to quickly share build
results.

## Remote execution

Remote caching isn’t a true distributed build. If the cache is lost or if you
make a low-level change that requires everything to be rebuilt, you still need
to perform the entire build locally on your machine. The true goal is to support
remote execution, in which the actual work of doing the build can be spread
across any number of workers. Figure 2 depicts a remote execution system.

[![Remote execution system](/images/remote-execution-system.png)](/images/remote-execution-system.png)

**Figure 2**. A remote execution system

The build tool running on each user’s machine (where users are either human
engineers or automated build systems) sends requests to a central build master.
The build master breaks the requests into their component actions and schedules
the execution of those actions over a scalable pool of workers. Each worker
performs the actions asked of it with the inputs specified by the user and
writes out the resulting artifacts. These artifacts are shared across the other
machines executing actions that require them until the final output can be
produced and sent to the user.

The trickiest part of implementing such a system is managing the communication
between the workers, the master, and the user’s local machine. Workers might
depend on intermediate artifacts produced by other workers, and the final output
needs to be sent back to the user’s local machine. To do this, we can build on
top of the distributed cache described previously by having each worker write
its results to and read its dependencies from the cache. The master blocks
workers from proceeding until everything they depend on has finished, in which
case they’ll be able to read their inputs from the cache. The final product is
also cached, allowing the local machine to download it. Note that we also need a
separate means of exporting the local changes in the user’s source tree so that
workers can apply those changes before building.

For this to work, all of the parts of the artifact-based build systems described
earlier need to come together. Build environments must be completely
self-describing so that we can spin up workers without human intervention. Build
processes themselves must be completely self-contained because each step might
be executed on a different machine. Outputs must be completely deterministic so
that each worker can trust the results it receives from other workers. Such
guarantees are extremely difficult for a task-based system to provide, which
makes it nigh-impossible to build a reliable remote execution system on top of
one.

## Distributed builds at Google

Since 2008, Google has been using a distributed build system that employs both
remote caching and remote execution, which is illustrated in Figure 3.

[![High-level build system](/images/high-level-build-system.png)](/images/high-level-build-system.png)

**Figure 3**. Google’s distributed build system

Google’s remote cache is called ObjFS. It consists of a backend that stores
build outputs in Bigtables distributed throughout our fleet of production
machines and a frontend FUSE daemon named objfsd that runs on each developer’s
machine. The FUSE daemon allows engineers to browse build outputs as if they
were normal files stored on the workstation, but with the file content
downloaded on-demand only for the few files that are directly requested by the
user. Serving file contents on-demand greatly reduces both network and disk
usage, and the system is able to build twice as fast compared to when we stored
all build output on the developer’s local disk.

Google’s remote execution system is called Forge. A Forge client in Blaze
(Bazel's internal equivalent) called
the Distributor sends requests for each action to a job running in our
datacenters called the Scheduler. The Scheduler maintains a cache of action
results, allowing it to return a response immediately if the action has already
been created by any other user of the system. If not, it places the action into
a queue. A large pool of Executor jobs continually read actions from this queue,
execute them, and store the results directly in the ObjFS Bigtables. These
results are available to the executors for future actions, or to be downloaded
by the end user via objfsd.

The end result is a system that scales to efficiently support all builds
performed at Google. And the scale of Google’s builds is truly massive: Google
runs millions of builds executing millions of test cases and producing petabytes
of build outputs from billions of lines of source code every day. Not only does
such a system let our engineers build complex codebases quickly, it also allows
us to implement a huge number of automated tools and systems that rely on our
build.

### Dependency Management
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/dependencies
- Source: basics/dependencies.mdx

In looking through the previous pages, one theme repeats over and over: managing
your own code is fairly straightforward, but managing its dependencies is much
more difficult. There are all sorts of dependencies: sometimes there’s a
dependency on a task (such as “push the documentation before I mark a release as
complete”), and sometimes there’s a dependency on an artifact (such as “I need
to have the latest version of the computer vision library to build my code”).
Sometimes, you have internal dependencies on another part of your codebase, and
sometimes you have external dependencies on code or data owned by another team
(either in your organization or a third party). But in any case, the idea of “I
need that before I can have this” is something that recurs repeatedly in the
design of build systems, and managing dependencies is perhaps the most
fundamental job of a build system.

## Dealing with Modules and Dependencies

Projects that use artifact-based build systems like Bazel are broken into a set
of modules, with modules expressing dependencies on one another via `BUILD`
files. Proper organization of these modules and dependencies can have a huge
effect on both the performance of the build system and how much work it takes to
maintain.

## Using Fine-Grained Modules and the 1:1:1 Rule

The first question that comes up when structuring an artifact-based build is
deciding how much functionality an individual module should encompass. In Bazel,
a _module_ is represented by a target specifying a buildable unit like a
`java_library` or a `go_binary`. At one extreme, the entire project could be
contained in a single module by putting one `BUILD` file at the root and
recursively globbing together all of that project’s source files. At the other
extreme, nearly every source file could be made into its own module, effectively
requiring each file to list in a `BUILD` file every other file it depends on.

Most projects fall somewhere between these extremes, and the choice involves a
trade-off between performance and maintainability. Using a single module for the
entire project might mean that you never need to touch the `BUILD` file except
when adding an external dependency, but it means that the build system must
always build the entire project all at once. This means that it won’t be able to
parallelize or distribute parts of the build, nor will it be able to cache parts
that it’s already built. One-module-per-file is the opposite: the build system
has the maximum flexibility in caching and scheduling steps of the build, but
engineers need to expend more effort maintaining lists of dependencies whenever
they change which files reference which.

Though the exact granularity varies by language (and often even within
language), Google tends to favor significantly smaller modules than one might
typically write in a task-based build system. A typical production binary at
Google often depends on tens of thousands of targets, and even a moderate-sized
team can own several hundred targets within its codebase. For languages like
Java that have a strong built-in notion of packaging, each directory usually
contains a single package, target, and `BUILD` file (Pants, another build system
based on Bazel, calls this the 1:1:1 rule). Languages with weaker packaging
conventions frequently define multiple targets per `BUILD` file.

The benefits of smaller build targets really begin to show at scale because they
lead to faster distributed builds and a less frequent need to rebuild targets.
The advantages become even more compelling after testing enters the picture, as
finer-grained targets mean that the build system can be much smarter about
running only a limited subset of tests that could be affected by any given
change. Because Google believes in the systemic benefits of using smaller
targets, we’ve made some strides in mitigating the downside by investing in
tooling to automatically manage `BUILD` files to avoid burdening developers.

Some of these tools, such as `buildifier` and `buildozer`, are available with
Bazel in the [`buildtools`
directory](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools).

## Minimizing Module Visibility

Bazel and other build systems allow each target to specify a visibility — a
property that determines which other targets may depend on it. A private target
can only be referenced within its own `BUILD` file. A target may grant broader
visibility to the targets of an explicitly defined list of `BUILD` files, or, in
the case of public visibility, to every target in the workspace.

As with most programming languages, it is usually best to minimize visibility as
much as possible. Generally, teams at Google will make targets public only if
those targets represent widely used libraries available to any team at Google.
Teams that require others to coordinate with them before using their code will
maintain an allowlist of customer targets as their target’s visibility. Each
team’s internal implementation targets will be restricted to only directories
owned by the team, and most `BUILD` files will have only one target that isn’t
private.

## Managing Dependencies

Modules need to be able to refer to one another. The downside of breaking a
codebase into fine-grained modules is that you need to manage the dependencies
among those modules (though tools can help automate this). Expressing these
dependencies usually ends up being the bulk of the content in a `BUILD` file.

### Internal dependencies

In a large project broken into fine-grained modules, most dependencies are
likely to be internal; that is, on another target defined and built in the same
source repository. Internal dependencies differ from external dependencies in
that they are built from source rather than downloaded as a prebuilt artifact
while running the build. This also means that there’s no notion of “version” for
internal dependencies—a target and all of its internal dependencies are always
built at the same commit/revision in the repository. One issue that should be
handled carefully with regard to internal dependencies is how to treat
transitive dependencies (Figure 1). Suppose target A depends on target B, which
depends on a common library target C. Should target A be able to use classes
defined in target C?

[![Transitive
dependencies](/images/transitive-dependencies.png)](/images/transitive-dependencies.png)

**Figure 1**. Transitive dependencies

As far as the underlying tools are concerned, there’s no problem with this; both
B and C will be linked into target A when it is built, so any symbols defined in
C are known to A. Bazel allowed this for many years, but as Google grew, we
began to see problems. Suppose that B was refactored such that it no longer
needed to depend on C. If B’s dependency on C was then removed, A and any other
target that used C via a dependency on B would break. Effectively, a target’s
dependencies became part of its public contract and could never be safely
changed. This meant that dependencies accumulated over time and builds at Google
started to slow down.

Google eventually solved this issue by introducing a “strict transitive
dependency mode” in Bazel. In this mode, Bazel detects whether a target tries to
reference a symbol without depending on it directly and, if so, fails with an
error and a shell command that can be used to automatically insert the
dependency. Rolling this change out across Google’s entire codebase and
refactoring every one of our millions of build targets to explicitly list their
dependencies was a multiyear effort, but it was well worth it. Our builds are
now much faster given that targets have fewer unnecessary dependencies, and
engineers are empowered to remove dependencies they don’t need without worrying
about breaking targets that depend on them.

As usual, enforcing strict transitive dependencies involved a trade-off. It made
build files more verbose, as frequently used libraries now need to be listed
explicitly in many places rather than pulled in incidentally, and engineers
needed to spend more effort adding dependencies to `BUILD` files. We’ve since
developed tools that reduce this toil by automatically detecting many missing
dependencies and adding them to a `BUILD` files without any developer
intervention. But even without such tools, we’ve found the trade-off to be well
worth it as the codebase scales: explicitly adding a dependency to `BUILD` file
is a one-time cost, but dealing with implicit transitive dependencies can cause
ongoing problems as long as the build target exists. Bazel [enforces strict
transitive
dependencies](https://blog.bazel.build/2017/06/28/sjd-unused_deps.html)
on Java code by default.

### External dependencies

If a dependency isn’t internal, it must be external. External dependencies are
those on artifacts that are built and stored outside of the build system. The
dependency is imported directly from an artifact repository (typically accessed
over the internet) and used as-is rather than being built from source. One of
the biggest differences between external and internal dependencies is that
external dependencies have versions, and those versions exist independently of
the project’s source code.

### Automatic versus manual dependency management

Build systems can allow the versions of external dependencies to be managed
either manually or automatically. When managed manually, the buildfile
explicitly lists the version it wants to download from the artifact repository,
often using a [semantic version string](https://semver.org/) such
as `1.1.4`. When managed automatically, the source file specifies a range of
acceptable versions, and the build system always downloads the latest one. For
example, Gradle allows a dependency version to be declared as “1.+” to specify
that any minor or patch version of a dependency is acceptable so long as the
major version is 1.

Automatically managed dependencies can be convenient for small projects, but
they’re usually a recipe for disaster on projects of nontrivial size or that are
being worked on by more than one engineer. The problem with automatically
managed dependencies is that you have no control over when the version is
updated. There’s no way to guarantee that external parties won’t make breaking
updates (even when they claim to use semantic versioning), so a build that
worked one day might be broken the next with no easy way to detect what changed
or to roll it back to a working state. Even if the build doesn’t break, there
can be subtle behavior or performance changes that are impossible to track down.

In contrast, because manually managed dependencies require a change in source
control, they can be easily discovered and rolled back, and it’s possible to
check out an older version of the repository to build with older dependencies.
Bazel requires that versions of all dependencies be specified manually. At even
moderate scales, the overhead of manual version management is well worth it for
the stability it provides.

### The One-Version Rule

Different versions of a library are usually represented by different artifacts,
so in theory there’s no reason that different versions of the same external
dependency couldn’t both be declared in the build system under different names.
That way, each target could choose which version of the dependency it wanted to
use. This causes a lot of problems in practice, so Google enforces a strict
[One-Version
Rule](https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/oneversion/) for
all third-party dependencies in our codebase.

The biggest problem with allowing multiple versions is the diamond dependency
issue. Suppose that target A depends on target B and on v1 of an external
library. If target B is later refactored to add a dependency on v2 of the same
external library, target A will break because it now depends implicitly on two
different versions of the same library. Effectively, it’s never safe to add a
new dependency from a target to any third-party library with multiple versions,
because any of that target’s users could already be depending on a different
version. Following the One-Version Rule makes this conflict impossible—if a
target adds a dependency on a third-party library, any existing dependencies
will already be on that same version, so they can happily coexist.

### Transitive external dependencies

Dealing with the transitive dependencies of an external dependency can be
particularly difficult. Many artifact repositories such as Maven Central, allow
artifacts to specify dependencies on particular versions of other artifacts in
the repository. Build tools like Maven or Gradle often recursively download each
transitive dependency by default, meaning that adding a single dependency in
your project could potentially cause dozens of artifacts to be downloaded in
total.

This is very convenient: when adding a dependency on a new library, it would be
a big pain to have to track down each of that library’s transitive dependencies
and add them all manually. But there’s also a huge downside: because different
libraries can depend on different versions of the same third-party library, this
strategy necessarily violates the One-Version Rule and leads to the diamond
dependency problem. If your target depends on two external libraries that use
different versions of the same dependency, there’s no telling which one you’ll
get. This also means that updating an external dependency could cause seemingly
unrelated failures throughout the codebase if the new version begins pulling in
conflicting versions of some of its dependencies.

Bazel did not use to automatically download transitive dependencies. It used to
employ a `WORKSPACE` file that required all transitive dependencies to be
listed, which led to a lot of pain when managing external dependencies. Bazel
has since added support for automatic transitive external dependency management
in the form of the `MODULE.bazel` file. See [external dependency
overview](/external/overview) for more details.

Yet again, the choice here is one between convenience and scalability. Small
projects might prefer not having to worry about managing transitive dependencies
themselves and might be able to get away with using automatic transitive
dependencies. This strategy becomes less and less appealing as the organization
and codebase grows, and conflicts and unexpected results become more and more
frequent. At larger scales, the cost of manually managing dependencies is much
less than the cost of dealing with issues caused by automatic dependency
management.

### Caching build results using external dependencies

External dependencies are most often provided by third parties that release
stable versions of libraries, perhaps without providing source code. Some
organizations might also choose to make some of their own code available as
artifacts, allowing other pieces of code to depend on them as third-party rather
than internal dependencies. This can theoretically speed up builds if artifacts
are slow to build but quick to download.

However, this also introduces a lot of overhead and complexity: someone needs to
be responsible for building each of those artifacts and uploading them to the
artifact repository, and clients need to ensure that they stay up to date with
the latest version. Debugging also becomes much more difficult because different
parts of the system will have been built from different points in the
repository, and there is no longer a consistent view of the source tree.

A better way to solve the problem of artifacts taking a long time to build is to
use a build system that supports remote caching, as described earlier. Such a
build system saves the resulting artifacts from every build to a location that
is shared across engineers, so if a developer depends on an artifact that was
recently built by someone else, the build system automatically downloads it
instead of building it. This provides all of the performance benefits of
depending directly on artifacts while still ensuring that builds are as
consistent as if they were always built from the same source. This is the
strategy used internally by Google, and Bazel can be configured to use a remote
cache.

### Security and reliability of external dependencies

Depending on artifacts from third-party sources is inherently risky. There’s an
availability risk if the third-party source (such as an artifact repository)
goes down, because your entire build might grind to a halt if it’s unable to
download an external dependency. There’s also a security risk: if the
third-party system is compromised by an attacker, the attacker could replace the
referenced artifact with one of their own design, allowing them to inject
arbitrary code into your build. Both problems can be mitigated by mirroring any
artifacts you depend on onto servers you control and blocking your build system
from accessing third-party artifact repositories like Maven Central. The
trade-off is that these mirrors take effort and resources to maintain, so the
choice of whether to use them often depends on the scale of the project. The
security issue can also be completely prevented with little overhead by
requiring the hash of each third-party artifact to be specified in the source
repository, causing the build to fail if the artifact is tampered with. Another
alternative that completely sidesteps the issue is to vendor your project’s
dependencies. When a project vendors its dependencies, it checks them into
source control alongside the project’s source code, either as source or as
binaries. This effectively means that all of the project’s external dependencies
are converted to internal dependencies. Google uses this approach internally,
checking every third-party library referenced throughout Google into a
`third_party` directory at the root of Google’s source tree. However, this works
at Google only because Google’s source control system is custom built to handle
an extremely large monorepo, so vendoring might not be an option for all
organizations.

### Hermeticity
- URL: https://bazel.build/basics/hermeticity
- Source: basics/hermeticity.mdx

This page covers hermeticity, the benefits of using hermetic builds, and
strategies for identifying non-hermetic behavior in your builds.

## Overview

When given the same input source code and product configuration, a hermetic
build system always returns the same output by isolating the build from changes
to the host system.

In order to isolate the build, hermetic builds are insensitive to libraries and
other software installed on the local or remote host machine. They depend on
specific versions of build tools, such as compilers, and dependencies, such as
libraries. This makes the build process self-contained as it doesn't rely on
services external to the build environment.

The two important aspects of hermeticity are:

* **Isolation**: Hermetic build systems treat tools as source code. They
  download copies of tools and manage their storage and use inside managed file
  trees. This creates isolation between the host machine and local user,
  including installed versions of languages.
* **Source identity**: Hermetic build systems try to ensure the sameness of
  inputs. Code repositories, such as Git, identify sets of code mutations with a
  unique hash code. Hermetic build systems use this hash to identify changes to
  the build's input.

## Benefits

The major benefits of hermetic builds are:

* **Speed**: The output of an action can be cached, and the action need not be
  run again unless inputs change.
* **Parallel execution**: For given input and output, the build system can
  construct a graph of all actions to calculate efficient and parallel
  execution. The build system loads the rules and calculates an action graph
  and hash inputs to look up in the cache.
* **Multiple builds**: You can build multiple hermetic builds on the same
  machine, each build using different tools and versions.
* **Reproducibility**: Hermetic builds are good for troubleshooting because you
  know the exact conditions that produced the build.

## Identifying non-hermeticity

If you are preparing to switch to Bazel, migration is easier if you improve
your existing builds' hermeticity in advance. Some common sources of
non-hermeticity in builds are:

* Arbitrary processing in `.mk` files
* Actions or tooling that create files non-deterministically, usually involving
  build IDs or timestamps
* System binaries that differ across hosts (such as `/usr/bin` binaries, absolute
  paths, system C++ compilers for native C++ rules autoconfiguration)
* Writing to the source tree during the build. This prevents the same source
  tree from being used for another target. The first build writes to the source
  tree, fixing the source tree for target A. Then trying to build target B may
  fail.

## Troubleshooting non-hermetic builds

Starting with local execution, issues that affect local cache hits reveal
non-hermetic actions.

* Ensure null sequential builds: If you run `make` and get a successful build,
  running the build again should not rebuild any targets. If you run each build
  step twice or on different systems, compare a hash of the file contents and
  get results that differ, the build is not reproducible.
* Run steps to
  [debug local cache hits](/remote/cache-remote#troubleshooting-cache-hits)
  from a variety of potential client machines to ensure that you catch any
  cases of client environment leaking into the actions.
* Execute a build within a docker container that contains nothing but the
  checked-out source tree and explicit list of host tools. Build breakages and
  error messages will catch implicit system dependencies.
* Discover and fix hermeticity problems using
  [remote execution rules](/remote/rules#overview).
* Enable strict [sandboxing](/docs/sandboxing)
  at the per-action level, since actions in a build can be stateful and affect
  the build or the output.
* [Workspace rules](/remote/workspace)
  allow developers to add dependencies to external workspaces, but they are
  rich enough to allow arbitrary processing to happen in the process. You can
  get a log of some potentially non-hermetic actions in Bazel workspace rules by
  adding the flag
  `--experimental_workspace_rules_log_file=<var>PATH</var>` to
  your Bazel command.

Note: Make your build fully hermetic when mixing remote and local execution,
using Bazel’s “dynamic strategy” functionality. Running Bazel inside the remote
Docker container will enable the build to execute the same in both environments.
