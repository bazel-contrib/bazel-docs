title: 'C++ Toolchain Configuration'
---

## Overview

To invoke the compiler with the right options, Bazel needs some knowledge about the compiler internals, such as include directories and important flags. In other words, Bazel needs a simplified model of the compiler to understand its workings.

Bazel needs to know the following:

- Whether the compiler supports thinLTO, modules, dynamic linking, or PIC (position independent code).
- Paths to the required tools such as gcc, ld, ar, objcopy, and so on.
- The built-in system include directories. Bazel needs these to validate that all headers that were included in the source file were properly declared in the `BUILD` file.
- The default sysroot.
- Which flags to use for compilation, linking, archiving.
- Which flags to use for the supported compilation modes (opt, dbg, fastbuild).
- Make variables specifically required by the compiler.

If the compiler has support for multiple architectures, Bazel needs to configure them separately.

[`CcToolchainConfigInfo`](/rules/lib/providers/CcToolchainConfigInfo) is a provider that provides the necessary level of granularity for configuring the behavior of Bazel's C++ rules. By default, Bazel automatically configures `CcToolchainConfigInfo` for your build, but you have the option to configure it manually. For that, you need a Starlark rule that provides the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` and you need to point the [`toolchain_config`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain.toolchain_config) attribute of the [`cc_toolchain`](/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_toolchain) to your rule. You can create the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` by calling [`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info()`](/rules/lib/toplevel/cc_common#create_cc_toolchain_config_info). You can find Starlark constructors for all structs you'll need in the process in [`@rules_cc//cc:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/blob/master/cc/cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl).

When a C++ target enters the analysis phase, Bazel selects the appropriate `cc_toolchain` target based on the `BUILD` file, and obtains the `CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider from the target specified in the `cc_toolchain.toolchain_config` attribute. The `cc_toolchain` target passes this information to the C++ target through a `CcToolchainProvider`.

For example, a compile or link action, instantiated by a rule such as `cc_binary` or `cc_library`, needs the following information:

- The compiler or linker to use
- Command-line flags for the compiler/linker
- Configuration flags passed through the `--copt/--linkopt` options
- Environment variables
- Artifacts needed in the sandbox in which the action executes

All of the above information except the artifacts required in the sandbox is specified in the Starlark target that the `cc_toolchain` points to.

The artifacts to be shipped to the sandbox are declared in the `cc_toolchain` target. For example, with the `cc_toolchain.linker_files` attribute you can specify the linker binary and toolchain libraries to ship into the sandbox.

## Toolchain selection

The toolchain selection logic operates as follows:

1. User specifies a `cc_toolchain_suite` target in the `BUILD` file and points Bazel to the target using the [`--crosstool_top` option](/docs/user-manual#flag--crosstool_top).

2. The `cc_toolchain_suite` target references multiple toolchains. The values of the `--cpu` and `--compiler` flags determine which of those toolchains is selected, either based only on the `--cpu` flag value, or based on a joint `--cpu | --compiler` value. The selection process is as follows:

- If the `--compiler` option is specified, Bazel selects the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains` attribute with `--cpu | --compiler`. If Bazel does not find a corresponding entry, it throws an error.

- If the `--compiler` option is not specified, Bazel selects the corresponding entry from the `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains` attribute with just `--cpu`.

- If no flags are specified, Bazel inspects the host system and selects a `--cpu` value based on its findings. See the [inspection mechanism code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/1b73bc37e184e71651eb631223dcce321ba16211:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/AutoCpuConverter.java).

Once a toolchain has been selected, corresponding `feature` and `action_config` objects in the Starlark rule govern the configuration of the build (that is, items described later). These messages allow the implementation of fully fledged C++ features in Bazel without modifying the Bazel binary. C++ rules support multiple unique actions documented in detail [in the Bazel source code](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/4f547a7ea86df80e4c76145ffdbb0c8b75ba3afa:tools/build_defs/cc/action_names.bzl).

## Features

A feature is an entity that requires command-line flags, actions, constraints on the execution environment, or dependency alterations. A feature can be something as simple as allowing `BUILD` files to select configurations of flags, such as `treat_warnings_as_errors`, or interact with the C++ rules and include new compile actions and inputs to the compilation, such as `header_modules` or `thin_lto`.

Ideally, `CcToolchainConfigInfo` contains a list of features, where each feature consists of one or more flag groups, each defining a list of flags that apply to specific Bazel actions.

A feature is specified by name, which allows full decoupling of the Starlark rule configuration from Bazel releases. In other words, a Bazel release does not affect the behavior of `CcToolchainConfigInfo` configurations as long as those configurations do not require the use of new features.

A feature is enabled in one of the following ways:

- The feature's `enabled` field is set to `true`.
- Bazel or the rule owner explicitly enable it.
- The user enables it through the `--feature` Bazel option or `features` rule attribute.

Features can have interdependencies, depend on command line flags, `BUILD` file settings, and other variables.

### Feature relationships

Dependencies are typically managed directly with Bazel, which simply enforces the requirements and manages conflicts intrinsic to the nature of the features defined in the build. The toolchain specification allows for more granular constraints for use directly within the Starlark rule that govern feature support and expansion. These are:

|                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constraint**                                                                                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ```
requires = [
   feature_set (features = [
       'feature-name-1',
       'feature-name-2'
   ]),
]
```          | Feature-level. The feature is supported only if the specified required features are enabled. For example, when a feature is only supported in certain build modes (`opt`, `dbg`, or `fastbuild`). If \`requires\` contains multiple \`feature\_set\`s the feature is supported if any of the \`feature\_set\`s is satisfied (when all specified features are enabled).                                                                                                |
| ```
implies = ['feature']
```                                                                                        | Feature-level. This feature implies the specified feature(s). Enabling a feature also implicitly enables all features implied by it (that is, it functions recursively).Also provides the ability to factor common subsets of functionality out of a set of features, such as the common parts of sanitizers. Implied features cannot be disabled.                                                                                                                    |
| ```
provides = ['feature']
```                                                                                       | Feature-level. Indicates that this feature is one of several mutually exclusive alternate features. For example, all of the sanitizers could specify `provides = ["sanitizer"]`.This improves error handling by listing the alternatives if the user asks for two or more mutually exclusive features at once.                                                                                                                                                        |
| ```
with_features = [
  with_feature_set(
    features = ['feature-1'],
    not_features = ['feature-2'],
  ),
]
``` | Flag set-level. A feature can specify multiple flag sets with multiple. When `with_features` is specified, the flag set will only expand to the build command if there is at least one `with_feature_set` for which all of the features in the specified `features` set are enabled, and all the features specified in `not_features` set are disabled. If `with_features` is not specified, the flag set will be applied unconditionally for every action specified. |

## Actions

Actions provide the flexibility to modify the circumstances under which an action executes without assuming how the action will be run. An `action_config` specifies the tool binary that an action invokes, while a `feature` specifies the configuration (flags) that determine how that tool behaves when the action is invoked.

[Features](#features) reference actions to signal which Bazel actions they affect since actions can modify the Bazel action graph. The `CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider contains actions that have flags and tools associated with them, such as `c++-compile`. Flags are assigned to each action by associating them with a feature.

Each action name represents a single type of action performed by Bazel, such as compiling or linking. There is, however, a many-to-one relationship between actions and Bazel action types, where a Bazel action type refers to a Java class that implements an action (such as `CppCompileAction`). In particular, the "assembler actions" and "compiler actions" in the table below are `CppCompileAction`, while the link actions are `CppLinkAction`.

### Assembler actions

|                       |                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action**            | **Description**                                           |
| `preprocess-assemble` | Assemble with preprocessing. Typically for `.S` files.    |
| `assemble`            | Assemble without preprocessing. Typically for `.s` files. |

### Compiler actions

|                          |                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `cc-flags-make-variable` | Propagates `CC_FLAGS` to genrules.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `c-compile`              | Compile as C.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `c++-compile`            | Compile as C++.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `c++-header-parsing`     | Run the compiler's parser on a header file to ensure that the header is self-contained, as it will otherwise produce compilation errors. Applies only to toolchains that support modules. |

### Link actions

|                                   |                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action**                        | **Description**                                             |
| `c++-link-dynamic-library`        | Link a shared library containing all of its dependencies.   |

| `c++-link-executable`             | Link a final ready-to-run library.                          |

### AR actions

AR actions assemble object files into archive libraries (`.a` files) via `ar` and encode some semantics into the name.

|                           |                                    |

### LTO actions

|               |                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Action**    | **Description**                                        |
| `lto-backend` | ThinLTO action compiling bitcodes into native objects. |
| `lto-index`   | ThinLTO action generating global index.                |

## Using action\_config

The `action_config` is a Starlark struct that describes a Bazel action by specifying the tool (binary) to invoke during the action and sets of flags, defined by features. These flags apply constraints to the action's execution.

The `action_config()` constructor has the following parameters:

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attribute** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `action_name` | The Bazel action to which this action corresponds. Bazel uses this attribute to discover per-action tool and execution requirements.                                                   |
| `tools`       | The executable to invoke. The tool applied to the action will be the first tool in the list with a feature set that matches the feature configuration. Default value must be provided. |
| `flag_sets`   | A list of flags that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a feature.                                                                                                             |
| `env_sets`    | A list of environment constraints that applies to a group of actions. Same as for a feature.                                                                                           |

An `action_config` can require and imply other features and `action_config`s as dictated by the [feature relationships](#feature-relationships) described earlier. This behavior is similar to that of a feature.

The last two attributes are redundant against the corresponding attributes on features and are included because some Bazel actions require certain flags or environment variables and the goal is to avoid unnecessary `action_config`+`feature` pairs. Typically, sharing a single feature across multiple `action_config`s is preferred.

You can not define more than one `action_config` with the same `action_name` within the same toolchain. This prevents ambiguity in tool paths and enforces the intention behind `action_config` - that an action's properties are clearly described in a single place in the toolchain.

### Using tool constructor

An`action_config` can specify a set of tools via its `tools` parameter. The `tool()` constructor takes in the following parameters:

|                 |                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Field**       | **Description**                                                                            |
| `path`          | Path to the tool in question (relative to the current location).                           |
| `with_features` | A list of feature sets out of which at least one must be satisfied for this tool to apply. |

For a given `action_config`, only a single `tool` applies its tool path and execution requirements to the Bazel action. A tool is selected by iterating through the `tools` attribute on an `action_config` until a tool with a `with_feature` set matching the feature configuration is found (see [Feature relationships](#feature-relationships) earlier on this page for more information). You should end your tool lists with a default tool that corresponds to an empty feature configuration.

### Example usage

Features and actions can be used together to implement Bazel actions with diverse cross-platform semantics. For example, debug symbol generation on macOS requires generating symbols in the compile action, then invoking a specialized tool during the link action to create compressed dsym archive, and then decompressing that archive to produce the application bundle and `.plist` files consumable by Xcode.

With Bazel, this process can instead be implemented as follows, with `unbundle-debuginfo` being a Bazel action:

```
load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

action_configs = [
    action_config (
        action_name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable,
        tools = [
            tool(
                with_features = [
                    with_feature(features=["generate-debug-symbols"]),
                ],
                path = "toolchain/mac/ld-with-dsym-packaging",
            ),
            tool (path = "toolchain/mac/ld"),
        ],
    ),
]

features = [
    feature(
        name = "generate-debug-symbols",
        flag_sets = [
            flag_set (
                actions = [
                    ACTION_NAMES.c_compile,
                    ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile
                ],
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group(
                        flags = ["-g"],
                    ),
                ],
            )
        ],
        implies = ["unbundle-debuginfo"],
   ),
]
```

This same feature can be implemented entirely differently for Linux, which uses `fission`, or for Windows, which produces `.pdb` files. For example, the implementation for `fission`-based debug symbol generation might look as follows:

```
load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "ACTION_NAMES")

action_configs = [
    action_config (
        name = ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile,
        tools = [
            tool(
                path = "toolchain/bin/gcc",
            ),
        ],
    ),
]

features = [
    feature (
        name = "generate-debug-symbols",
        requires = [with_feature_set(features = ["dbg"])],
        flag_sets = [
            flag_set(
                actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_compile],
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group(
                        flags = ["-gsplit-dwarf"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
            flag_set(
                actions = [ACTION_NAMES.cpp_link_executable],
                flag_groups = [
                    flag_group(
                        flags = ["-Wl", "--gdb-index"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
      ],
    ),
]
```

### Flag groups

`CcToolchainConfigInfo` allows you to bundle flags into groups that serve a specific purpose. You can specify a flag within using pre-defined variables within the flag value, which the compiler expands when adding the flag to the build command. For example:

```
flag_group (
    flags = ["%{output_execpath}"],
)
```

In this case, the contents of the flag will be replaced by the output file path of the action.

Flag groups are expanded to the build command in the order in which they appear in the list, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

For flags that need to repeat with different values when added to the build command, the flag group can iterate variables of type `list`. For example, the variable `include_path` of type `list`:

```
flag_group (
    iterate_over = "include_paths",
    flags = ["-I%{include_paths}"],
)
```

expands to `-I&lt;path&gt;` for each path element in the `include_paths` list. All flags (or `flag_group`s) in the body of a flag group declaration are expanded as a unit. For example:

```
flag_group (
    iterate_over = "include_paths",
    flags = ["-I", "%{include_paths}"],
)
```

expands to `-I &lt;path&gt;` for each path element in the `include_paths` list.

A variable can repeat multiple times. For example:

```
flag_group (
    iterate_over = "include_paths",
    flags = ["-iprefix=%{include_paths}", "-isystem=%{include_paths}"],
)
```

expands to:

```
-iprefix=&lt;inc0&gt; -isystem=&lt;inc0&gt; -iprefix=&lt;inc1&gt; -isystem=&lt;inc1&gt;
```

Variables can correspond to structures accessible using dot-notation. For example:

```
flag_group (
    flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.name}"],
)
```

Structures can be nested and may also contain sequences. To prevent name clashes and to be explicit, you must specify the full path through the fields. For example:

```
flag_group (
    iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
    flag_groups = [
        flag_group (
            iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
            flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Conditional expansion

Flag groups support conditional expansion based on the presence of a particular variable or its field using the `expand_if_available`, `expand_if_not_available`, `expand_if_true`, `expand_if_false`, or `expand_if_equal` attributes. For example:

```
flag_group (
    iterate_over = "libraries_to_link",
    flag_groups = [
        flag_group (
            iterate_over = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries",
            flag_groups = [
                flag_group (
                    expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                    flags = ["--whole_archive"],
                ),
                flag_group (
                    flags = ["-l%{libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.name}"],
                ),
                flag_group (
                    expand_if_available = "libraries_to_link.shared_libraries.is_whole_archive",
                    flags = ["--no_whole_archive"],
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

Note: The `--whole_archive` and `--no_whole_archive` options are added to the build command only when a currently iterated library has an `is_whole_archive` field.

| **`force_pic`**                          | link           | Presence of this variable indicates that PIC/PIE code should be generated (Bazel option \`--force\_pic\` was passed).                                                                          |
| **`strip_debug_symbols`**                | link           | Presence of this variable indicates that the debug symbols should be stripped.                                                                                                                 |
| **`is_cc_test`**                         | link           | Truthy when current action is a `cc_test` linking action, false otherwise.                                                                                                                     |
| **`is_using_fission`**                   | compile, link  | Presence of this variable indicates that fission (per-object debug info) is activated. Debug info will be in `.dwo` files instead of `.o` files and the compiler and linker need to know this. |
| **`fdo_instrument_path`**                | compile, link  | Path to the directory that stores FDO instrumentation profile.                                                                                                                                 |

| **`opt \| dbg \| fastbuild`**                     | Enabled by default based on compilation mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`static_linking_mode \| dynamic_linking_mode`** | Enabled by default based on linking mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`per_object_debug_info`**                       | Enabled if the `supports_fission` feature is specified and enabled and the current compilation mode is specified in the `--fission` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`supports_start_end_lib`**                      | If enabled (and the option `--start_end_lib` is set), Bazel will not link against static libraries but instead use the `--start-lib/--end-lib` linker options to link against objects directly. This speeds up the build since Bazel doesn't have to build static libraries.                                                                                                |
| **`supports_interface_shared_libraries`**         | If enabled (and the option `--interface_shared_objects` is set), Bazel will link targets that have `linkstatic` set to False (`cc_test`s by default) against interface shared libraries. This makes incremental relinking faster.                                                                                                                                           |
| **`supports_dynamic_linker`**                     | If enabled, C++ rules will know the toolchain can produce shared libraries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`static_link_cpp_runtimes`**                    | If enabled, Bazel will link the C++ runtime statically in static linking mode and dynamically in dynamic linking mode. Artifacts specified in the `cc_toolchain.static_runtime_lib` or `cc_toolchain.dynamic_runtime_lib` attribute (depending on the linking mode) will be added to the linking actions.                                                                   |
| **`supports_pic`**                                | If enabled, toolchain will know to use PIC objects for dynamic libraries. The \`pic\` variable is present whenever PIC compilation is needed. If not enabled by default, and \`--force\_pic\` is passed, Bazel will request \`supports\_pic\` and validate that the feature is enabled. If the feature is missing, or couldn't be enabled, \`--force\_pic\` cannot be used. |
| **`static_linking_mode \| dynamic_linking_mode`** | Enabled by default based on linking mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`no_legacy_features`**                          | Prevents Bazel from adding legacy features to the C++ configuration when present. See the complete list of features below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`shorten_virtual_includes`**                    | If enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/&lt;hash of target path&gt;` instead of `bin/&lt;target package path&gt;/_virtual_includes/&lt;target name&gt;`. Useful on Windows to avoid long path issue with MSVC.                                                                                                                     |

This is a long list of features. The plan is to get rid of them once [Crosstool in Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380) is done. For the curious reader see the implementation in [CppActionConfigs](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CppActionConfigs.java?q=cppactionconfigs\&ss=bazel), and for production toolchains consider adding `no_legacy_features` to make the toolchain more standalone.
