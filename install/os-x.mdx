title: 'Installing Bazel on macOS'
---

This page describes how to install Bazel on macOS and set up your environment.

You can install Bazel on macOS using one of the following methods:

- *Recommended*: [Use Bazelisk](/install/bazelisk)
- [Use Homebrew](#install-on-mac-os-x-homebrew)
- [Use the binary installer](#install-with-installer-mac-os-x)
- [Compile Bazel from source](/install/compile-source)

Bazel comes with two completion scripts. After installing Bazel, you can:

- Access the [bash completion script](/install/completion#bash)
- Install the [zsh completion script](/install/completion#zsh)

## Installing using Homebrew

### Step 1: Install Homebrew on macOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a one-time step):

```posix-terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 2: Install Bazel via Homebrew

Install the Bazel package via Homebrew as follows:

```posix-terminal
brew install bazel
```

All set! You can confirm Bazel is installed successfully by running the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel --version
```

Once installed, you can upgrade to a newer version of Bazel using the following command:

```posix-terminal
brew upgrade bazel
```

## Installing using the binary installer

The binary installers are on Bazel's [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases).

The installer contains the Bazel binary. Some additional libraries must also be installed for Bazel to work.

### Step 1: Install Xcode command line tools

If you don't intend to use `ios_*` rules, it is sufficient to install the Xcode command line tools package by using `xcode-select`:

```posix-terminal
xcode-select --install
```

Otherwise, for `ios_*` rule support, you must have Xcode 6.1 or later with iOS SDK 8.1 installed on your system.

Download Xcode from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) or the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode).

Once Xcode is installed, accept the license agreement for all users with the following command:

```posix-terminal
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Step 2: Download the Bazel installer

Next, download the Bazel binary installer named `bazel-&lt;version&gt;-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh` from the [Bazel releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases).

**On macOS Catalina or newer (macOS >= 11)**, due to Apple's new app signing requirements, you need to download the installer from the terminal using `curl`, replacing the version variable with the Bazel version you want to download:

```posix-terminal
export BAZEL_VERSION=5.2.0

curl -fLO "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/&lt;var&gt;$BAZEL_VERSION&lt;/var&gt;/bazel-&lt;var&gt;$BAZEL_VERSION&lt;/var&gt;-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh"
```

This is a temporary workaround until the macOS release flow supports signing ([#9304](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9304)).

### Step 3: Run the installer

Run the Bazel installer as follows:

```posix-terminal
chmod +x "bazel-&lt;var&gt;$BAZEL_VERSION&lt;/var&gt;-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh"

./bazel-&lt;var&gt;$BAZEL_VERSION&lt;/var&gt;-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh --user
```

The `--user` flag installs Bazel to the `$HOME/bin` directory on your system and sets the `.bazelrc` path to `$HOME/.bazelrc`. Use the `--help` command to see additional installation options.

If you are **on macOS Catalina or newer (macOS >= 11)** and get an error that ***“bazel-real” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified***, you need to re-download the installer from the terminal using `curl` as a workaround; see Step 2 above.

### Step 4: Set up your environment

If you ran the Bazel installer with the `--user` flag as above, the Bazel executable is installed in your `&lt;var&gt;HOME&lt;/var&gt;/bin` directory. It's a good idea to add this directory to your default paths, as follows:

```posix-terminal
export PATH="&lt;var&gt;PATH&lt;/var&gt;:&lt;var&gt;HOME&lt;/var&gt;/bin"
```

You can also add this command to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` file.

All set! You can confirm Bazel is installed successfully by running the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel --version
```

To update to a newer release of Bazel, download and install the desired version.
