## --aspect_deps 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

How to resolve aspect dependencies when the output format is one of {xml,proto,record}. 'off' means no aspect dependencies are resolved, 'conservative' (the default) means all declared aspect dependencies are added regardless of whether they are given the rule class of direct dependencies, 'precise' means that only those aspects are added that are possibly active given the rule class of the direct dependencies. Note that precise mode requires loading other packages to evaluate a single target thus making it slower than the other modes. Also note that even precise mode is not completely precise: the decision whether to compute an aspect is decided in the analysis phase, which is not run during 'bazel query'.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

How many WorkRequests a multiplex worker process may receive in parallel if you use the 'worker' strategy with --worker_multiplex. May be specified as [name=value] to give a different value per mnemonic. The limit is based on worker keys, which are differentiated based on mnemonic, but also on startup flags and environment, so there can in some cases be more workers per mnemonic than this flag specifies. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 'auto' calculates a reasonable default based on machine capacity. "=value" sets a default for unspecified mnemonics.

_May apply to commands: startup_

## --flaky_test_attempts 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Each test will be retried up to the specified number of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt to pass are marked as 'FLAKY' in the test summary. Normally the value specified is just an integer or the string 'default'. If an integer, then all tests will be run up to N times. If 'default', then only a single test attempt will be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts. Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test). Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing matches, behavior is as if 'default' above.

How many instances of each kind of persistent worker may be launched if you use the 'worker' strategy. May be specified as [name=value] to give a different value per mnemonic. The limit is based on worker keys, which are differentiated based on mnemonic, but also on startup flags and environment, so there can in some cases be more workers per mnemonic than this flag specifies. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 'auto' calculates a reasonable default based on machine capacity. "=value" sets a default for unspecified mnemonics.

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

If true, a shortname for the target platform is used in the output directory name instead of the CPU. The exact scheme is experimental and subject to change: First, in the rare case the --platforms option does not have exactly one value, a hash of the platforms option is used. Next, if any shortname for the current platform was registered by --experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir, then that shortname is used. Then, if --experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic is set, use a shortname based off the current platform Label. Finally, a hash of the platform option is used as a last resort.

## --aspects 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if aspect some_aspect specifies required aspect providers via required_aspect_providers, some_aspect will run after every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised providers satisfy some_aspect required aspect providers. Moreover, some_aspect will run after all its required aspects specified by requires attribute. some_aspect will then have access to the values of those aspects' providers. <bzl-file-label>%<aspect_name>, for example '//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect', where 'my_aspect' is a top-level value from a file tools/my_def.bzl

A comma-separated set of target patterns (additive and subtractive). The query may be performed in the universe defined by the transitive closure of the specified targets. This option is used for the query and cquery commands.
For cquery, the input to this option is the targets all answers are built under and so this option may affect configurations and transitions. If this option is not specified, the top-level targets are assumed to be the targets parsed from the query expression. Note: For cquery, not specifying this option may cause the build to break if targets parsed from the query expression are not buildable with top-level options.

## --experimental_remote_cache_ttl 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

The guaranteed minimal TTL of blobs in the remote cache after their digests are recently referenced e.g. by an ActionResult or FindMissingBlobs.

## --experimental_dynamic_local_load_factor 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Controls how much load from dynamic execution to put on the local machine. This flag adjusts how many actions in dynamic execution we will schedule concurrently. It is based on the number of CPUs Blaze thinks is available, which can be controlled with the --local_cpu_resources flag.
If this flag is 0, all actions are scheduled locally immediately. If > 0, the amount of actions scheduled locally is limited by the number of CPUs available. If < 1, the load factor is used to reduce the number of locally scheduled actions when the number of actions waiting to schedule is high. This lessens the load on the local machine in the clean build case, where the local machine does not contribute much.

## --tool_deps 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Query: If disabled, dependencies on 'exec configuration' will not be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An 'exec configuration' dependency edge, such as the one from any 'proto_library' rule to the Protocol Compiler, usually points to a tool executed during the build rather than a part of the same 'target' program.
Cquery: If disabled, filters out all configured targets which cross an execution transition from the top-level target that discovered this configured target. That means if the top-level target is in the target configuration, only configured targets also in the target configuration will be returned. If the top-level target is in the exec configuration, only exec configured targets will be returned. This option will NOT exclude resolved toolchains.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --experimental_sibling_repository_layout 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

If set to true, non-main repositories are planted as symlinks to the main repository in the execution root. That is, all repositories are direct children of the $output_base/execution_root directory. This has the side effect of freeing up $output_base/execution_root/__main__/external for the real top-level 'external' directory.

_May apply to commands: analyze-profile, aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, sync, test, vendor, version_

## --incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

## --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

The value represents the % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch. When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they can.

## --experimental_builtins_injection_override 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

A comma-separated list of symbol names prefixed by a + or - character, indicating which symbols from `@_builtins//:exports.bzl` to inject, overriding their default injection status. Precisely, this works as follows. Each dict key of `exported_toplevels` or `exported_rules` has the form `foo`, `+foo`, or `-foo`. The first two forms mean it gets injected by default, while the last form means it does not get injected by default. In the first case (unprefixed), the default is absolute and cannot be overridden. Otherwise, we then consult this options list, and if we see foo occur here, we take the prefix of its last occurrence and use that to decide whether or not to inject. It is a no-op to specify an unknown symbol, or to attempt to not inject a symbol that occurs unprefixed in a dict key.

When output is fully ordered, nodes are printed in a fully deterministic (total) order. First, all nodes are sorted alphabetically. Then, each node in the list is used as the start of a post-order depth-first search in which outgoing edges to unvisited nodes are traversed in alphabetical order of the successor nodes. Finally, nodes are printed in the reverse of the order in which they were visited.

## --experimental_unsupported_and_brittle_include_scanning 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Whether to narrow inputs to C/C++ compilation by parsing #include lines from input files. This can improve performance and incrementality by decreasing the size of compilation input trees. However, it can also break builds because the include scanner does not fully implement C preprocessor semantics. In particular, it does not understand dynamic #include directives and ignores preprocessor conditional logic. Use at your own risk. Any issues relating to this flag that are filed will be closed.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_remote_scrubbing_config 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Enables remote cache key scrubbing with the supplied configuration file, which must be a protocol buffer in text format (see src/main/protobuf/remote_scrubbing.proto).

This feature is intended to facilitate sharing a remote/disk cache between actions executing on different platforms but targeting the same platform. It should be used with extreme care, as improper settings may cause accidental sharing of cache entries and result in incorrect builds.

Scrubbing does not affect how an action is executed, only how its remote/disk cache key is computed for the purpose of retrieving or storing an action result. Scrubbed actions are incompatible with remote execution, and will always be executed locally instead.

Modifying the scrubbing configuration does not invalidate outputs present in the local filesystem or internal caches; a clean build is required to reexecute affected actions.

In order to successfully use this feature, you likely want to set a custom --host_platform together with --experimental_platform_in_output_dir (to normalize output prefixes) and --incompatible_strict_action_env (to normalize environment variables).

_May apply to commands: analyze-profile, aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, sync, test, vendor, version_

## --enable_platform_specific_config 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

If true, Bazel picks up host-OS-specific config lines from bazelrc files. For example, if the host OS is Linux and you run bazel build, Bazel picks up lines starting with build:linux. Supported OS identifiers are linux, macos, windows, freebsd, and openbsd. Enabling this flag is equivalent to using --config=linux on Linux, --config=windows on Windows, etc.

## --experimental_builtins_bzl_path 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

This flag tells Bazel how to find the "@_builtins" .bzl files that govern how predeclared symbols for BUILD and .bzl files are defined. This flag is only intended for Bazel developers, to help when writing @_builtins .bzl code. Ordinarily this value is set to "%bundled%", which means to use the builtins_bzl/ directory packaged in the Bazel binary. However, it can be set to the path (relative to the root of the current workspace) of an alternate builtins_bzl/ directory, such as one in a Bazel source tree workspace. A literal value of "%workspace%" is equivalent to the relative package path of builtins_bzl/ within a Bazel source tree; this should only be used when running Bazel within its own source tree. Finally, a value of the empty string disables the builtins injection mechanism entirely.

_May apply to commands: analyze-profile, aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, sync, test, vendor, version_

## --incompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

If enabled, "bazel test --run_under=//:runner" builds "//:runner" in the exec configuration. If disabled, it builds "//:runner" in the target configuration. Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This doesn't affect "bazel run", which always builds "`--run_under=//foo" in the target configuration.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --expunge_async 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

If specified, clean asynchronously removes the entire working tree for this %{product} instance, which includes all %{product}-created temporary and build output files, and stops the %{product} server if it is running. When this command completes, it will be safe to execute new commands in the same client, even though the deletion may continue in the background.

_May apply to commands: clean_

## --remote_download_symlink_template 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Instead of downloading remote build outputs to the local machine, create symbolic links. The target of the symbolic links can be specified in the form of a template string. This template string may contain {hash} and {size_bytes} that expand to the hash of the object and the size in bytes, respectively. These symbolic links may, for example, point to a FUSE file system that loads objects from the CAS on demand.

A comma-separated list of rules (or other symbols) that were previously part of Bazel and which are now to be retrieved from their respective external repositories. This flag is intended to be used to facilitate migration of rules out of Bazel. See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043.
A symbol that is autoloaded within a file behaves as if its built-into-Bazel definition were replaced by its canonical new definition in an external repository. For a BUILD file, this essentially means implicitly adding a load() statement. For a .bzl file, it's either a load() statement or a change to a field of the `native` object, depending on whether the autoloaded symbol is a rule.
Bazel maintains a hardcoded list of all symbols that may be autoloaded; only those symbols may appear in this flag. For each symbol, Bazel knows the new definition location in an external repository, as well as a set of special-cased repositories that must not autoload it to avoid creating cycles.
A list item of "+foo" in this flag causes symbol foo to be autoloaded, except in foo's exempt repositories, within which the Bazel-defined version of foo is still available.
A list item of "foo" triggers autoloading as above, but the Bazel-defined version of foo is not made available to the excluded repositories. This ensures that foo's external repository does not depend on the old Bazel implementation of foo
A list item of "-foo" does not trigger any autoloading, but makes the Bazel-defined version of foo inaccessible throughout the workspace. This is used to validate that the workspace is ready for foo's definition to be deleted from Bazel.
If a symbol is not named in this flag then it continues to work as normal -- no autoloading is done, nor is the Bazel-defined version suppressed. For configuration see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/packages/AutoloadSymbols.java As a shortcut also whole repository may be used, for example +@rules_python will autoload all Python rules.

Use Propeller profile information to optimize the build target.A propeller profile must consist of at least one of two files, a cc profile and a ld profile.  This flag accepts a build label which must refer to the propeller profile input files. For example, the BUILD file that defines the label, in a/b/BUILD:propeller_optimize(    name = "propeller_profile",    cc_profile = "propeller_cc_profile.txt",    ld_profile = "propeller_ld_profile.txt",)An exports_files directive may have to be added to the corresponding package to make these files visible to Bazel. The option must be used as: --propeller_optimize=//a/b:propeller_profile

## --modify_execution_info 

History:
-  Introduced in Bazel x.x.x

Add or remove keys from an action's execution info based on action mnemonic.  Applies only to actions which support execution info. Many common actions support execution info, e.g. Genrule, CppCompile, Javac, StarlarkAction, TestRunner. When specifying multiple values, order matters because many regexes may apply to the same mnemonic.

Syntax: "regex=[+-]key,regex=[+-]key,...".

Examples:
  '.*=+x,.*=-y,.*=+z' adds 'x' and 'z' to, and removes 'y' from, the execution info for all actions.
  'Genrule=+requires-x' adds 'requires-x' to the execution info for all Genrule actions.
  '(?!Genrule).*=-requires-x' removes 'requires-x' from the execution info for all non-Genrule actions.
