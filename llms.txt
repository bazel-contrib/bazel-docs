  - [Intro to Bazel](https://bazel.build/about/intro) — Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle.
It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in
multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple…

Even simple binaries can often depend on tens of thousands of build targets. At
this scale, it’s simply impossible to complete a build in a…
  - [Dependency Management](https://bazel.build/basics/dependencies) — In looking through the previous pages, one theme repeats over and over: managing
your own code is fairly straightforward, but managing its dependencies is much
more difficult. There are all sorts of dependencies…
