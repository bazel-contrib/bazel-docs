title: Bazel flags
---

## --incompatible_no_implicit_watch_label 

If true, then methods on &lt;code&gt;repository_ctx&lt;/code&gt; that are passed a Label will no longer automatically watch the file under that label for changes even if &lt;code&gt;watch = "no"&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;repository_ctx.path&lt;/code&gt; no longer causes the returned path to be watched. Use &lt;code&gt;repository_ctx.watch&lt;/code&gt; instead.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --internal_persistent_multiplex_busybox_tools 

Tracking flag for when multiplexed busybox workers are enabled.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --autodetect_server_javabase 

When --noautodetect_server_javabase is passed, Bazel does not fall back to the local JDK for running the bazel server and instead exits.

_May apply to commands: startup_

## --host_conlyopt 

Additional option to pass to the C compiler when compiling C (but not C++) source files in the exec configurations.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --instrumentation_filter 

When coverage is enabled, only rules with names included by the
specified regex-based filter will be instrumented. Rules prefixed
with '-' are excluded instead. Note that only non-test rules are
instrumented unless `--instrument_test_targets` is enabled. 


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --action_cache_store_output_metadata 

no-op



_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --remote_build_event_upload 

If set to 'all', all local outputs referenced by BEP are uploaded to remote cache.
If set to 'minimal', local outputs referenced by BEP are not uploaded to the remote cache, except for files that are important to the consumers of BEP (e.g. test logs and timing profile). bytestream:// scheme is always used for the uri of files even if they are missing from remote cache.
Default to 'minimal'.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --experimental_incremental_dexing_after_proguard 

Whether to use incremental dexing tools when building proguarded Android binaries.  Values &gt; 0 turn the feature on, values &gt; 1 run that many dexbuilder shards.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling 

If set (the default), critical path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations in some cases.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --allowed_local_actions_regex 

A regex whitelist for action types which may be run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --device_debug_entitlements 

If set, and compilation mode is not 'opt', objc apps will include debug entitlements when signing.

## --aspect_deps 

How to resolve aspect dependencies when the output format is one of {xml,proto,record}. 'off' means no aspect dependencies are resolved, 'conservative' (the default) means all declared aspect dependencies are added regardless of whether they are given the rule class of direct dependencies, 'precise' means that only those aspects are added that are possibly active given the rule class of the direct dependencies. Note that precise mode requires loading other packages to evaluate a single target thus making it slower than the other modes. Also note that even precise mode is not completely precise: the decision whether to compute an aspect is decided in the analysis phase, which is not run during 'bazel query'.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --experimental_worker_sandbox_inmemory_tracking 

A worker key mnemonic for which the contents of the sandbox directory are tracked in memory. This may improve build performance at the cost of additional memory usage. Only affects sandboxed workers. May be specified multiple times for different mnemonics.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --incompatible_depset_for_libraries_to_link_getter

## --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux 

On linux, run all workers in its own cgroup (without any limits set) and use the cgroup's own resource accounting for memory measurements. This is overridden by --experimental_worker_sandbox_hardening for sandboxed workers.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --worker_multiplex 

If enabled, workers will use multiplexing if they support it. 

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --dynamic_remote_strategy 

The remote strategies, in order, to use for the given mnemonic - the first applicable strategy is used. If no mnemonic is given, the list of strategies is used as the fallback for all mnemonics. The default fallback list is `remote`, so this flag usually does not need to be set explicitly. Takes [mnemonic=]remote_strategy[,remote_strategy,...]

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_run_in_user_cgroup

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --run_under 

Prefix to insert before the executables for the `test` and `run` commands.
If the value is `foo -bar`, and the execution command line is `test_binary -baz`,
then the final command line is `foo -bar test_binary -baz`.
This can also be a label to an executable target. Some examples are:
- `valgrind`
- `strace`
- `strace -c`
- `valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20`
- `//package:target`
- `//package:target --options`


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --show_make_env 

Include the "Make" environment in the output.

_May apply to commands: info_

## --experimental_docker_image 

Specify a Docker image name (e.g. "ubuntu:latest") that should be used to execute a sandboxed action when using the docker strategy and the action itself doesn't already have a container-image attribute in its remote_execution_properties in the platform description. The value of this flag is passed verbatim to 'docker run', so it supports the same syntax and mechanisms as Docker itself.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --cc_include_scanning 

Whether to narrow inputs to C/C++ compilation by parsing #include lines from input files. This can improve performance and incrementality by decreasing the size of compilation input trees. However, it can also break builds because the include scanner does not fully implement C preprocessor semantics. In particular, it does not understand dynamic #include directives and ignores preprocessor conditional logic. Use at your own risk. Any issues relating to this flag that are filed will be closed. At Google without this flag your build will most likely fail.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --android_dynamic_mode 

Determines whether C++ deps of Android rules will be linked dynamically when a cc_binary does not explicitly create a shared library. 'default' means bazel will choose whether to link dynamically.  'fully' means all libraries will be linked dynamically. 'off' means that all libraries will be linked in mostly static mode.

Include timestamps in messages

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --experimental_worker_metrics_poll_interval 

The interval between collecting worker metrics and possibly attempting evictions. Cannot effectively be less than 1s for performance reasons.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --quiet 

If true, no informational messages are emitted on the console, only errors. Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.

_May apply to commands: startup_

## --share_native_deps 

If true, native libraries that contain identical functionality will be shared among different targets

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

environment. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which
case its value will be read from the Bazel client environment, or by the
`name=value` pair.
Previously set variables can be unset via `=name`.
This option can be used multiple times to specify several variables.
Used only by the 'bazel test' command.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --incompatible_enforce_starlark_utf8 

If enabled (or set to 'error'), fail if Starlark files are not UTF-8 encoded. If set to 'warning', emit a warning instead. If set to 'off', Bazel assumes that Starlark files are UTF-8 encoded but does not verify this assumption. Note that Starlark files which are not UTF-8 encoded can cause Bazel to behave inconsistently.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --sandbox_debug 

Enables debugging features for the sandboxing feature. This includes two things: first, the sandbox root contents are left untouched after a build; and second, prints extra debugging information on execution. This can help developers of Bazel or Starlark rules with debugging failures due to missing input files, etc.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_use_hermetic_linux_sandbox 

If set to true, do not mount root, only mount whats provided with sandbox_add_mount_pair. Input files will be hardlinked to the sandbox instead of symlinked to from the sandbox. If action input files are located on a filesystem different from the sandbox, then the input files will be copied instead.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --build_tests_only 

If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default everything that was requested will be built.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --check_bzl_visibility 

If disabled, .bzl load visibility errors are demoted to warnings.

## --incompatible_disallow_empty_glob 

If set to true, the default value of the `allow_empty` argument of glob() is False.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --proto_toolchain_for_java 

Label of proto_lang_toolchain() which describes how to compile Java protos

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --remote_local_fallback 

Whether to fall back to standalone local execution strategy if remote execution fails.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --crosstool_top 

No-op flag. Will be removed in a future release.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --remote_header 

Specify a header that will be included in requests: --remote_header=Name=Value. Multiple headers can be passed by specifying the flag multiple times. Multiple values for the same name will be converted to a comma-separated list.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive 

When enabled, passing multiple `--modify_execution_info` flags is additive.
When disabled, only the last flag is taken into account.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --strict_system_includes 

If true, headers found through system include paths (-isystem) are also required to be declared.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --remote_max_connections 

Limit the max number of concurrent connections to remote cache/executor. By default the value is 100. Setting this to 0 means no limitation.
For HTTP remote cache, one TCP connection could handle one request at one time, so Bazel could make up to --remote_max_connections concurrent requests.
For gRPC remote cache/executor, one gRPC channel could usually handle 100+ concurrent requests, so Bazel could make around `--remote_max_connections * 100` concurrent requests.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --ignore_unsupported_sandboxing 

Do not print a warning when sandboxed execution is not supported on this system.

## --repository_cache 

Specifies the cache location of the downloaded values obtained
during the fetching of external repositories. An empty string
as argument requests the cache to be disabled,
otherwise the default of `{--output_user_root}/cache/repos/v1` is used.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --android_manifest_merger

## --unlimit_coredumps 

Raises the soft coredump limit to the hard limit to make coredumps of the server (including the JVM) and the client possible under common conditions. Stick this flag in your bazelrc once and forget about it so that you get coredumps when you actually encounter a condition that triggers them.

_May apply to commands: startup_

## --use_target_platform_for_tests 

If true, use the target platform for running tests rather than the test exec group.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --expand_test_suites 

Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --adb 

adb binary to use for the 'mobile-install' command. If unspecified, the one in the Android SDK specified by the --android_sdk_channel command line option (or  the default SDK if --android_sdk_channel is not specified) is used.

_May apply to commands: mobile-install_

## --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator 

Use the Skyframe-based target pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

No-op

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --use_ijars 

If enabled, this option causes Java compilation to use interface jars. This will result in faster incremental compilation, but error messages can be different.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only 

Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --ios_simulator_device 

The device to simulate when running an iOS application in the simulator, e.g. 'iPhone 6'. You can get a list of devices by running 'xcrun simctl list devicetypes' on the machine the simulator will be run on.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --incompatible_package_group_includes_double_slash 

If enabled, when outputting package_group's `packages` attribute, the leading `//` will not be omitted.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --incompatible_validate_top_level_header_inclusions 

This flag is a noop and scheduled for removal.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --heap_dump_on_oom 

Whether to manually output a heap dump if an OOM is thrown (including manual OOMs due to reaching --gc_thrashing_limits). The dump will be written to &lt;output_base&gt;/&lt;invocation_id&gt;.heapdump.hprof. This option effectively replaces -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError, which has no effect for manual OOMs.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --inject_repository 

Adds a new repository with a local path in the form of `{repository name}={path}`. This
only takes effect with `--enable_bzlmod` and is equivalent to adding a
corresponding `local_repository` to the root module's `MODULE.bazel` file via
`use_repo_rule`. If the given path is an absolute path, it will be used as it is.
If the given path is a relative path, it is relative to the current working
directory. If the given path starts with `%workspace%`, it is relative to the
workspace root, which is the output of `bazel info workspace`. If the given path
is empty, then remove any previous injections.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --skyframe_high_water_mark_threshold 

Flag for advanced configuration of Bazel's internal Skyframe engine. If Bazel detects its retained heap percentage usage is at least this threshold, it will drop unnecessary temporary Skyframe state. Tweaking this may let you mitigate wall time impact of GC thrashing, when the GC thrashing is (i) caused by the memory usage of this temporary state and (ii) more costly than reconstituting the state when it is needed.

## --runs_per_test 

Specifies number of times to run each test. If any of those attempts fail for any
reason, the whole test is considered failed. Normally the value specified is
just an integer.

Alternate syntax: `regex_filter@runs_per_test`. Where `runs_per_test` stands for
an integer value and `regex_filter` stands for a list of include and exclude
regular expression patterns (Also see --instrumentation_filter).

Example: `--runs_per_test=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3` runs all tests in `//foo/` except
those under `//foo/bar` three times. This option can be passed multiple times. The most
recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing matches,
the test is only run once.

while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
`--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
bar are built.

## --worker_max_multiplex_instances 

How many WorkRequests a multiplex worker process may receive in parallel if you use the 'worker' strategy with --worker_multiplex. May be specified as [name=value] to give a different value per mnemonic. The limit is based on worker keys, which are differentiated based on mnemonic, but also on startup flags and environment, so there can in some cases be more workers per mnemonic than this flag specifies. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]&lt;float&gt;) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 'auto' calculates a reasonable default based on machine capacity. "=value" sets a default for unspecified mnemonics.

## --output_base 

If set, specifies the output location to which all build output will be written. Otherwise, the location will be ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/_blaze_${USER}/${MD5_OF_WORKSPACE_ROOT}. Note: If you specify a different option from one to the next Bazel invocation for this value, you'll likely start up a new, additional Bazel server. Bazel starts exactly one server per specified output base. Typically there is one output base per workspace - however, with this option you may have multiple output bases per workspace and thereby run multiple builds for the same client on the same machine concurrently. See 'bazel help shutdown' on how to shutdown a Bazel server.

## --sandbox_explicit_pseudoterminal 

Explicitly enable the creation of pseudoterminals for sandboxed actions. Some linux distributions require setting the group id of the process to 'tty' inside the sandbox in order for pseudoterminals to function. If this is causing issues, this flag can be disabled to enable other groups to be used.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --infer_universe_scope 

If set and --universe_scope is unset, then a value of --universe_scope will be inferred as the list of unique target patterns in the query expression. Note that the --universe_scope value inferred for a query expression that uses universe-scoped functions (e.g.`allrdeps`) may not be what you want, so you should use this option only if you know what you are doing. See https://bazel.build/reference/query#sky-query for details and examples. If --universe_scope is set, then this option's value is ignored. Note: this option applies only to `query` (i.e. not `cquery`).

inherit specific environment variables from the client, but note that doing so
can prevent cross-user caching if a shared cache is used.

## --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_size 

If set to a positive value, the disk cache will be periodically garbage collected to stay under this size. If set in conjunction with --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_age, both criteria are applied. Garbage collection occurrs in the background once the server has become idle, as determined by the --experimental_disk_cache_gc_idle_delay flag.

positive integer value is specified it will override all categories.  If 4
comma-separated integers are specified, they will override the timeouts for
`short`, `moderate`, `long` and `eternal` (in that order). In either form, a value of
-1 tells blaze to use its default timeouts for that category.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --relative_locations

## --flaky_test_attempts 

Each test will be retried up to the specified number of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt to pass are marked as 'FLAKY' in the test summary. Normally the value specified is just an integer or the string 'default'. If an integer, then all tests will be run up to N times. If 'default', then only a single test attempt will be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts. Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test). Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing matches, behavior is as if 'default' above.

## --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing 

If non-negative, the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --remote_download_outputs 

If set to 'minimal' doesn't download any remote build outputs to the local machine, except the ones required by local actions. If set to 'toplevel' behaves like 'minimal' except that it also downloads outputs of top level targets to the local machine. Both options can significantly reduce build times if network bandwidth is a bottleneck.

## --worker_max_instances 

How many instances of each kind of persistent worker may be launched if you use the 'worker' strategy. May be specified as [name=value] to give a different value per mnemonic. The limit is based on worker keys, which are differentiated based on mnemonic, but also on startup flags and environment, so there can in some cases be more workers per mnemonic than this flag specifies. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]&lt;float&gt;) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 'auto' calculates a reasonable default based on machine capacity. "=value" sets a default for unspecified mnemonics.

## --experimental_platform_in_output_dir 

If true, a shortname for the target platform is used in the output directory name
instead of the CPU. The exact scheme is experimental and subject to change:
1. First, in the rare case the `--platforms` option does not have exactly one value, a
   hash of the platforms option is used.
2. Next, if any shortname for the current platform was registered by
   `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`, then that shortname is used.
3. Then, if `--experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic` is set, use a
   shortname based off the current platform Label.
4. Finally, a hash of the platform option is used as a last resort.

## --per_file_ltobackendopt 

Additional options to selectively pass to LTO backend (under --features=thin_lto) when compiling certain backend objects. This option can be passed multiple times. Syntax: regex_filter@option_1,option_2,...,option_n. Where regex_filter stands for a list of include and exclude regular expression patterns. option_1 to option_n stand for arbitrary command line options. If an option contains a comma it has to be quoted with a backslash. Options can contain @. Only the first @ is used to split the string. Example: --per_file_ltobackendopt=//foo/.*\.o,-//foo/bar\.o@-O0 adds the -O0 command line option to the LTO backend command line of all o files in //foo/ except bar.o.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format 

Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
`--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
`proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --credential_helper 

Configures a credential helper conforming to the [Credential Helper Specification][ch-spec]

`--google_default_credentials`, `--google_credentials`, a `.netrc` file, or the
 auth parameter to `repository_ctx.download()` and
`repository_ctx.download_and_extract()`.

May be specified multiple times to set up multiple helpers.

See [Configuring Bazel's Credential Helper - Engflow Blog][ch-example] for instructions.

relative path, it is relative to the current working directory. If the given path
starts with `%workspace%`, it is relative to the workspace root, which is the
output of `bazel info workspace`. If the given path is empty, then remove any
previous overrides.

Specifies the set of environment variables available to actions with execution
configurations. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which case the
value will be taken from the invocation environment, by the `name=value` pair
which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by
`=name`, which unsets the variable of that name. This option can
be used multiple times; for options given for the same variable, the latest
wins, options for different variables accumulate.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
`required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
`some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
`requires` attribute.
`some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
providers.
`{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
`my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.

_May apply to commands: coverage, cquery, fetch, test, vendor_

## --universe_scope 

A comma-separated set of target patterns (additive and subtractive). The query may be performed in the universe defined by the transitive closure of the specified targets. This option is used for the query and cquery commands.
For cquery, the input to this option is the targets all answers are built under and so this option may affect configurations and transitions. If this option is not specified, the top-level targets are assumed to be the targets parsed from the query expression. Note: For cquery, not specifying this option may cause the build to break if targets parsed from the query expression are not buildable with top-level options.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --experimental_ui_max_stdouterr_bytes 

The maximum size of the stdout / stderr files that will be printed to the console. -1 implies no limit.

## --experimental_remote_cache_ttl 

The guaranteed minimal TTL of blobs in the remote cache after their digests are recently referenced e.g. by an ActionResult or FindMissingBlobs. Bazel does several optimizations based on the blobs' TTL e.g. doesn't repeatedly call GetActionResult in an incremental build. The value should be set slightly less than the real TTL since there is a gap between when the server returns the digests and when Bazel receives them.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --experimental_active_directories 

Active directories for Skyfocus and remote analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths. This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations, until it is redefined with a new set.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --proto:rule_classes 

Populate the rule_class_key field of each rule; and for the first rule with a given rule_class_key, also populate its rule_class_info proto field. The rule_class_key field uniquely identifies a rule class, and the rule_class_info field is a Stardoc-format rule class API definition.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode 

If true, use the most recent Xcode that is available both locally and remotely. If false, or if there are no mutual available versions, use the local Xcode version selected via xcode-select.

`@@canonical_repo_name`. Only works when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.


_May apply to commands: fetch, vendor_

## --build_event_max_named_set_of_file_entries 

The maximum number of entries for a single `named_set_of_files` event; values smaller
than 2 are ignored and no event splitting is performed. This is intended for
limiting the maximum event size in the build event protocol, although it does not
directly control event size. The total event size is a function of the structure
of the set as well as the file and uri lengths, which may in turn depend on the
hash function.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --override_module 

Override a module with a local path in the form of `{module name}={path}`. If the given
path is an absolute path, it will be used as it is. If the given path is a
relative path, it is relative to the current working directory. If the given path
starts with `%workspace%`, it is relative to the workspace root, which is the
output of `bazel info workspace`. If the given path is empty, then remove any
previous overrides.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --repositories_without_autoloads 

A list of additional repositories (beyond the hardcoded ones Bazel knows about) where autoloads are not to be added. This should typically contain repositories that are transitively depended on by a repository that may be loaded automatically (and which can therefore potentially create a cycle).

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --mobile_install_aspect 

The aspect to use for mobile-install.

_May apply to commands: mobile-install_

## --remote_executor 

HOST or HOST:PORT of a remote execution endpoint. The supported schemas are grpc, grpcs (grpc with TLS enabled) and unix (local UNIX sockets). If no schema is provided Bazel will default to grpcs. Specify grpc:// or unix: schema to disable TLS.

which flags to set when a platform already exists. Must be relative to the main
workspace root. Defaults to `platform_mappings` (a file directly under the
workspace root).


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_dynamic_local_load_factor 

Controls how much load from dynamic execution to put on the local machine. This flag adjusts how many actions in dynamic execution we will schedule concurrently. It is based on the number of CPUs Blaze thinks is available, which can be controlled with the --local_resources=cpu= flag.
If this flag is 0, all actions are scheduled locally immediately. If &gt; 0, the amount of actions scheduled locally is limited by the number of CPUs available. If &lt; 1, the load factor is used to reduce the number of locally scheduled actions when the number of actions waiting to schedule is high. This lessens the load on the local machine in the clean build case, where the local machine does not contribute much.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --non_incremental_per_target_dexopts 

dx flags that that prevent incremental dexing for binary targets that list any of the flags listed here in their 'dexopts' attribute, which are ignored with incremental dexing (superseding --dexopts_supported_in_incremental_dexing).  Defaults to --positions for safety but can in general be used to make sure the listed dx flags are honored, with additional build latency.  Please notify us if you find yourself needing this flag.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

If true, an analysis failure of a rule target results in the target's propagation
of an instance of `AnalysisFailureInfo` containing the error description, instead
of resulting in a build failure.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --gc_churning_threshold 

At any point after an invocation has been running for at least one minute, if Blaze has spent at least this percentage of the invocation's wall time doing full GCs, Blaze will give up and fail with an OOM. A value of 100 effectively means to never give up for this reason.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --experimental_execution_graph_enable_edges_from_filewrite_actions 

Handle edges from filewrite actions to their inputs correctly.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --record_full_profiler_data 

By default, Bazel profiler will record only aggregated data for fast but numerous events (such as statting the file). If this option is enabled, profiler will record each event - resulting in more precise profiling data but LARGE performance hit. Option only has effect if --profile used as well.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

The format in which cquery will print transition information.

_May apply to commands: cquery_

## --isatty 

A system-generated parameter which is used to notify the server whether this client is running in a terminal. If this is set to false, then '--color=auto' will be treated as '--color=no'. If this is set to true, then '--color=auto' will be treated as '--color=yes'.

The platforms that are available as execution platforms to run actions.
Platforms can be specified by exact target, or as a target pattern.
These platforms will be considered before those declared in the `WORKSPACE` file by
`register_execution_platforms()`. This option may only be set once; later
instances will override earlier flag settings.


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --incompatible_remove_ctx_bazel_py_fragment

For each action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_remote_downloader 

A Remote Asset API endpoint URI, to be used as a remote download proxy. The supported schemas are grpc, grpcs (grpc with TLS enabled) and unix (local UNIX sockets). If no schema is provided Bazel will default to grpcs. See: https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/master/build/bazel/remote/asset/v1/remote_asset.proto

## --module_mirrors 

A comma-separated list of URLs under which the source URLs of Bazel modules can be found,
in addition to and taking precedence over any registry-provided mirror URLs. Set this to
an empty value to disable the use of any mirrors not specified by the registries. The
default set of mirrors may change over time, but all downloads from mirrors are verified
by hashes stored in the registry (and thus pinned by the lockfile).


_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --tool_deps 

Query: If disabled, dependencies on 'exec configuration' will not be included in the dependency graph over which the query operates. An 'exec configuration' dependency edge, such as the one from any 'proto_library' rule to the Protocol Compiler, usually points to a tool executed during the build rather than a part of the same 'target' program.
Cquery: If disabled, filters out all configured targets which cross an execution transition from the top-level target that discovered this configured target. That means if the top-level target is in the target configuration, only configured targets also in the target configuration will be returned. If the top-level target is in the exec configuration, only exec configured targets will be returned. This option will NOT exclude resolved toolchains.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --reuse_sandbox_directories 

If set to true, directories used by sandboxed non-worker execution may be reused to avoid unnecessary setup costs.

## --test_output 

Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests, 'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless of --test_strategy value).

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_sibling_repository_layout 

If set to true, non-main repositories are planted as symlinks to the main repository in the execution root. That is, all repositories are direct children of the $output_base/execution_root directory. This has the side effect of freeing up $output_base/execution_root/__main__/external for the real top-level 'external' directory.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --remote_downloader_header 

Specify a header that will be included in remote downloader requests: --remote_downloader_header=Name=Value. Multiple headers can be passed by specifying the flag multiple times. Multiple values for the same name will be converted to a comma-separated list.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage 

The value represents the % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch. When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they can.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_builtins_injection_override 

A comma-separated list of symbol names prefixed by a + or - character, indicating which symbols from `@_builtins//:exports.bzl` to inject, overriding their default injection status. Precisely, this works as follows. Each dict key of `exported_toplevels` or `exported_rules` has the form `foo`, `+foo`, or `-foo`. The first two forms mean it gets injected by default, while the last form means it does not get injected by default. In the first case (unprefixed), the default is absolute and cannot be overridden. Otherwise, we then consult this options list, and if we see foo occur here, we take the prefix of its last occurrence and use that to decide whether or not to inject. It is a no-op to specify an unknown symbol, or to attempt to not inject a symbol that occurs unprefixed in a dict key.

## --include_config_fragments_provider 

INTERNAL BLAZE DEVELOPER FEATURE: If `direct`, all configured targets expose
RequiredConfigFragmentsProvider with the configuration fragments they directly
require.
If `transitive`, they do the same but also include the fragments their
transitive dependencies require. If `off`, the provider is omitted.

If not `off`, this also populates `config_setting`'s
`ConfigMatchingProvider.requiredFragmentOptions` with the fragment options the
`config_setting` requires.

Be careful using this feature: it adds memory to every configured target in the
build.

## --experimental_sandbox_async_tree_delete_idle_threads 

If 0, sandboxes are deleted as soon as actions finish, blocking action completion. If greater than 0, sandboxes are deleted asynchronously in the background without blocking action completion. Asynchronous deletion uses a single thread while a command is running, but ramps up to as many threads as the value of this flag once the server becomes idle. Set to `auto` to use as many threads as the number of CPUs. A server shutdown blocks on any pending asynchronous deletions.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]&lt;float&gt;) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_local_lockfree_output 

When true, the local spawn runner doesn't lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_allow_map_directory 

If enabled, Bazel allows the use of ctx.actions.map_directory(). This allows for the creation of actions based on the files in a directory through a user defined Starlark function and a &lt;code&gt;template_ctx&lt;/code&gt; that supports basic action generation APIs.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_spawn_scheduler 

Enable dynamic execution by running actions locally and remotely in parallel. Bazel spawns each action locally and remotely and picks the one that completes first. If an action supports workers, the local action will be run in the persistent worker mode. To enable dynamic execution for an individual action mnemonic, use the `--internal_spawn_scheduler` and `--strategy=&lt;mnemonic&gt;=dynamic` flags instead.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --repo_env 

Specifies additional environment variables to be available only for repository rules. Note that repository rules see the full environment anyway, but in this way variables can be set via command-line flags and &lt;code&gt;.bazelrc&lt;/code&gt; entries. The special syntax &lt;code&gt;=NAME&lt;/code&gt; can be used to explicitly unset a variable.

## --order_output 

Output the results unordered (no), dependency-ordered (deps), or fully ordered (full). The default is 'auto', meaning that results are output either dependency-ordered or fully ordered, depending on the output formatter (dependency-ordered for proto, minrank, maxrank, and graph, fully ordered for all others). When output is fully ordered, nodes are printed in a fully deterministic (total) order. First, all nodes are sorted alphabetically. Then, each node in the list is used as the start of a post-order depth-first search in which outgoing edges to unvisited nodes are traversed in alphabetical order of the successor nodes. Finally, nodes are printed in the reverse of the order in which they were visited.

_May apply to commands: query_

## --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters 

Tune memory profile's computation of stable heap at end of build. Should be and even number of  integers separated by commas. In each pair the first integer is the number of GCs to perform.

## --experimental_check_output_files 

Check for modifications made to the output files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they won't have to check a previous run's cache.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_cpp_modules 

Enables experimental C++20 modules support. Use it with `module_interfaces` attribute on `cc_binary` and `cc_library`. While the support is behind the experimental flag, there are no guarantees about incompatible changes to it or even keeping the support in the future. Consider those risks when using it.

## --experimental_unsupported_and_brittle_include_scanning 

Whether to narrow inputs to C/C++ compilation by parsing #include lines from input files. This can improve performance and incrementality by decreasing the size of compilation input trees. However, it can also break builds because the include scanner does not fully implement C preprocessor semantics. In particular, it does not understand dynamic #include directives and ignores preprocessor conditional logic. Use at your own risk. Any issues relating to this flag that are filed will be closed. At Google without this flag your build will most likely fail.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_remote_scrubbing_config 

Enables remote cache key scrubbing with the supplied configuration file, which must be a protocol buffer in text format (see src/main/protobuf/remote_scrubbing.proto).

This feature is intended to facilitate sharing a remote/disk cache between actions executing on different platforms but targeting the same platform. It should be used with extreme care, as improper settings may cause accidental sharing of cache entries and result in incorrect builds.

Scrubbing does not affect how an action is executed, only how its remote/disk cache key is computed for the purpose of retrieving or storing an action result. Scrubbed actions are incompatible with remote execution, and will always be executed locally instead.

Modifying the scrubbing configuration does not invalidate outputs present in the local filesystem or internal caches; a clean build is required to reexecute affected actions.

In order to successfully use this feature, you likely want to set a custom --host_platform together with --experimental_platform_in_output_dir (to normalize output prefixes) and --incompatible_strict_action_env (to normalize environment variables).

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

The local strategies, in order, to use for the given mnemonic - the first applicable strategy is used. For example, `worker,sandboxed` runs actions that support persistent workers using the worker strategy, and all others using the sandboxed strategy. If no mnemonic is given, the list of strategies is used as the fallback for all mnemonics. The default fallback list is `worker,sandboxed`, or`worker,sandboxed,standalone` if `experimental_local_lockfree_output` is set. Takes [mnemonic=]local_strategy[,local_strategy,...]

## --enable_platform_specific_config 

If true, Bazel picks up host-OS-specific config lines from bazelrc files. For example, if the host OS is Linux and you run bazel build, Bazel picks up lines starting with build:linux. Supported OS identifiers are linux, macos, windows, freebsd, and openbsd. Enabling this flag is equivalent to using --config=linux on Linux, --config=windows on Windows, etc.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, fetch, info, mobile-install, print_action, run, test, vendor_

## --experimental_builtins_bzl_path 

This flag tells Bazel how to find the "@_builtins" .bzl files that govern how predeclared symbols for BUILD and .bzl files are defined. This flag is only intended for Bazel developers, to help when writing @_builtins .bzl code. Ordinarily this value is set to "%bundled%", which means to use the builtins_bzl/ directory packaged in the Bazel binary. However, it can be set to the path (relative to the root of the current workspace) of an alternate builtins_bzl/ directory, such as one in a Bazel source tree workspace. A literal value of "%workspace%" is equivalent to the relative package path of builtins_bzl/ within a Bazel source tree; this should only be used when running Bazel within its own source tree. Finally, a value of the empty string disables the builtins injection mechanism entirely.

_May apply to commands: aquery, build, canonicalize-flags, clean, config, coverage, cquery, dump, fetch, help, info, license, mobile-install, mod, print_action, query, run, shutdown, test, vendor, version_

## --bes_outerr_buffer_size

## --incompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under 

If enabled, `bazel test --run_under=//:runner` builds `//:runner` in the exec
configuration. If disabled, it builds `//:runner` in the target configuration.
Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This
doesn't affect `bazel run`, which always builds `--run_under=//foo` in the
target configuration.

_May apply to commands: aquery, cquery, query_

## --expunge_async 

If specified, clean asynchronously removes the entire working tree for this %{product} instance, which includes all %{product}-created temporary and build output files, and stops the %{product} server if it is running. When this command completes, it will be safe to execute new commands in the same client, even though the deletion may continue in the background.

_May apply to commands: clean_

## --remote_download_symlink_template 

Instead of downloading remote build outputs to the local machine, create symbolic links. The target of the symbolic links can be specified in the form of a template string. This template string may contain {hash} and {size_bytes} that expand to the hash of the object and the size in bytes, respectively. These symbolic links may, for example, point to a FUSE file system that loads objects from the CAS on demand.

## --experimental_include_scanning_parallelism 

Configures the size of the thread pool used for include scanning. Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]&lt;float&gt;) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means to disable parallelism and to just rely on the build graph parallelism for concurrency.  "auto" means to use a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number of processors).

## --incompatible_autoload_externally 

A comma-separated list of rules (or other symbols) that were previously part of Bazel and which are now to be retrieved from their respective external repositories. This flag is intended to be used to facilitate migration of rules out of Bazel. See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043.
A symbol that is autoloaded within a file behaves as if its built-into-Bazel definition were replaced by its canonical new definition in an external repository. For a BUILD file, this essentially means implicitly adding a load() statement. For a .bzl file, it's either a load() statement or a change to a field of the `native` object, depending on whether the autoloaded symbol is a rule.
Bazel maintains a hardcoded list of all symbols that may be autoloaded; only those symbols may appear in this flag. For each symbol, Bazel knows the new definition location in an external repository, as well as a set of special-cased repositories that must not autoload it to avoid creating cycles.
A list item of "+foo" in this flag causes symbol foo to be autoloaded, except in foo's exempt repositories, within which the Bazel-defined version of foo is still available.
A list item of "foo" triggers autoloading as above, but the Bazel-defined version of foo is not made available to the excluded repositories. This ensures that foo's external repository does not depend on the old Bazel implementation of foo
A list item of "-foo" does not trigger any autoloading, but makes the Bazel-defined version of foo inaccessible throughout the workspace. This is used to validate that the workspace is ready for foo's definition to be deleted from Bazel.
If a symbol is not named in this flag then it continues to work as normal -- no autoloading is done, nor is the Bazel-defined version suppressed. For configuration see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/packages/AutoloadSymbols.java As a shortcut also whole repository may be used, for example +@rules_python will autoload all Python rules.

## --default_test_resources 

Override the default resources amount for tests. The expected format is
`{resource}={value}`. If a single positive number is specified as `{value}`
it will override the default resources for all test sizes. If 4
comma-separated numbers are specified, they will override the resource
amount for respectively the `small`, `medium`, `large`, `enormous` test sizes.
Values can also be `HOST_RAM`/`HOST_CPU`, optionally followed
by `[-|*]{float}` (eg. `memory=HOST_RAM*.1,HOST_RAM*.2,HOST_RAM*.3,HOST_RAM*.4`).
The default test resources specified by this flag are overridden by explicit
resources specified in tags.

## --show_result 

Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
default is one.

If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
under the threshold.

## --modify_execution_info 

Add or remove keys from an action's execution info based on action mnemonic.
Applies only to actions which support execution info. Many common actions
support execution info, e.g. Genrule, CppCompile, Javac, StarlarkAction,
TestRunner. When specifying multiple values, order matters because
many regexes may apply to the same mnemonic.

Syntax: `regex=[+-]key,regex=[+-]key,...`.

Examples:
- `.*=+x,.*=-y,.*=+z` adds `x` and `z` to, and removes `y` from, the execution info for all actions.
- `Genrule=+requires-x` adds `requires-x` to the execution info for all Genrule actions.
- `(?!Genrule).*=-requires-x` removes `requires-x` from the execution info for all non-Genrule actions.

## --ignore_dev_dependency 

If true, Bazel ignores `bazel_dep` and `use_extension` declared as `dev_dependency` in
the `MODULE.bazel` of the root module. Note that, those dev dependencies are always
ignored in the `MODULE.bazel` if it's not the root module regardless of the value
of this flag.

## --skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation 

Flag for advanced configuration of Bazel's internal Skyframe engine. If Bazel detects its retained heap percentage usage exceeds the threshold set by --skyframe_high_water_mark_threshold, when a full GC event occurs, it will drop unnecessary temporary Skyframe state, up to this many times per invocation. Defaults to 10. Zero means that full GC events will never trigger drops. If the limit is reached, Skyframe state will no longer be dropped when a full GC event occurs and that retained heap percentage threshold is exceeded.

## --bazelrc 

The location of the user .bazelrc file containing default values of Bazel options.
`/dev/null` indicates that all further `--bazelrc`s will be ignored, which is useful to
disable the search for a user rc file, e.g. in release builds.

This option can also be specified multiple times. e.g. with
`--bazelrc=x.rc --bazelrc=y.rc --bazelrc=/dev/null --bazelrc=z.rc`.
1. `x.rc` and `y.rc` are read.
2. `z.rc` is ignored due to the prior `/dev/null`.
If unspecified, Bazel uses the first `.bazelrc` file it finds in
the following two locations: the workspace directory, then the user's home
directory.

Note: command line options will always supersede any option in bazelrc.


_May apply to commands: startup_

## --trim_test_configuration

If set to a value in [0, 100] and this is a command that takes top-level targets (e.g. build but not query) and there are multiple such top-level targets, overrides --gc_churning_threshold. Useful to configure more aggressive OOMing behavior (i.e. a lower value than --gc_churning_threshold) when they are multiple top-level targets so that the invoker of Bazel can split and retry while still having less aggressive behavior when there is a single top-level target.

granularity; it is an error to set a value less than one second. By default,
keep-alive pings are disabled. You should coordinate with the service owner
before enabling this setting. For example to set a value of 30 seconds to this
flag, it should be done as this `--grpc_keepalive_time=30s`.
